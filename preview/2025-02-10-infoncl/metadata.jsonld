    "abstract": "As part of the budget approval process, it is necessary to establish a Net Change Limit. This serves as an opportunity for all governance stakeholders to formally express their positions regarding the proposed Net Change Limit, ensuring transparency, accountability, and alignment with organizational objectives.\n\nThe Net Change Limit will start at the beginning of Epoch 532 and progress for 72 epochs, concluding at the end of Epoch 604, December 2025. The Net Change Limit shall be 350,000,000,000,000 lovelaces (350M ada).\n\nThe Net Change Limit will be used when reviewing both budget actions and treasury withdrawal actions to ensure constitutionality as required by Article IV of the Constitution and the Treasury Withdrawal Guardrails outlined in Appendix I.",
    "motivation": "Prior to the submission of any budget request, a Net Change Limit must be formally agreed upon. Failure to establish a Net Change Limit shall render any such budget request unconstitutional and therefore inapplicable.\n\nThe Net Change Limit shall be effective for the period specified in this action. In the event that a mutually agreed Net Change Limit is not established for subsequent periods, the most recently approved Net Change Limit shall remain in force by default.\n\nThe Net Change Limit shall remain in effect until such time as a new Net Change Limit is formally approved in accordance with the applicable governance procedures.",
	  "rationale": "The Net Change Limit will start at the beginning of Epoch 532 and progress for 72 epochs, concluding at the end of Epoch 604, December 2025.\n\nThe Net Change Limit for this period shall be set at 350,000,000,000,000 lovelaces (350M ada). This limit shall be applied in the assessment of both budget actions and treasury withdrawal actions to ensure compliance with Article IV of the Constitution and the Treasury Withdrawal Guardrails specified in Appendix I of the Constitution.\n\nThe Net Change Limit of 350,000,000,000,000 lovelaces (350M ada) shall automatically apply to each 73-epoch period, unless modified through formal approval. For example:\n- 2025 Net Change Limit of 350,000,000,000,000 lovelaces (350M ada)\n- 2026 Net Change Limit of 350,000,000,000,000 lovelaces (350M ada)\n- Until a new Net Change Limit has been approved\n\nA vote in favour of this proposal shall indicate agreement with the proposed Net Change Limit, allowing the process to advance to a Governance Action at the earliest permissible opportunity.\n\nIn accordance with governance procedures, this action shall be ratified if more than 67% of the delegated adaada to DReps vote in favour. This is in alignment with TREASURY-01a (x), which requires that a Net Change Limit for the Cardano treasuryâ€™s balance per period must be agreed upon by the DReps through an on-chain governance action with a threshold of greater than 67% of the active voting stake.",
