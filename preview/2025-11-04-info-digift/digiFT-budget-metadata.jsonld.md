# Title

Budget: ₳6M for bringing RWA’s to Cardano

# Abstract

This proposal seeks a ₳**6,000,000** budget from the Cardano Treasury to fund an institutional, regulated platform implementing an on-chain smart contract exchange for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) on Cardano by [DigiFT](https://www.digift.io/).  
DigiFT aims to **strengthen Cardano’s position as an institutional-grade blockchain** for Real-World Asset (RWA) adoption by integrating USDA stablecoin with institutional  
RWAs and providing real-time liquidity pools for instant redemption. This will drive TVL growth, increase transaction volumes, and create a compliant bridge between traditional finance and Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem.

**Key deliverables include:**

* Deployment of Plutus smart contracts for on-chain RWA issuance, mint/burn, subscription and redemption functions.  
* Integration of Cardano’s USDA stablecoin for RWA transactions (enabling 1:1 stablecoin subscription/redemption).  
* Creation of 24/7 institutional liquidity pools with instant redemption features.  
* A compliant infrastructure stack (licensing, KYC/AML, security audits) for onboarding global institutional assets.

With this Budget Info Action, we aim to transparently share a revised direction and gauge broad community support. If positively received, it will enable the submission of a follow-up Treasury Withdrawal governance action.The funds from this action will be administered by Intersect, contingent on milestone-based progress.

# Motivation

### Why this proposal matters

There is a noticeable gap between Cardano’s DeFi and real-world asset (RWA) compared to other major blockchains by introducing a fully regulated, institutional-grade platform. Through DigiFT’s existing licenses, partnerships with global financial issuers like UBS and Invesco, and proven multi-chain experience, Cardano can immediately attract institutional capital, boost on-chain liquidity, and enable compliant tokenization of real-world assets. By funding this proposal would position Cardano as a credible bridge between traditional finance and decentralized finance, driving sustainable growth, legitimacy, and long-term ecosystem value.

### **This proposal aims to address the following challenges:**

1. **Innovation, Mindshare and Brand Positioning vs. competitor DeFi ecosystem maturity gap. Lack of RWA presence, the long-term opportunity.**  
   Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem, while growing, currently lags competitors like Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and Avalanche (AVAX) in terms of total value locked (TVL), developer activity, and user adoption. This gap limits Cardano’s ability to attract institutional players seeking more mature and battle-tested platforms. Cardano faces a need to differentiate itself from competitors by clearly articulating its unique value proposition in the RWA space, which offers a significantly long-tail of growth, evidenced by the significant growth of the TradFi space entering RWA; e.g. UBS, Blackrock, Fidelity, Invesco, Wellington, CMBI, DBS, Citi, Bank of New York Mellon, Nomura, Soc Gen, SBI Group, Citadel, Brevan Howard, etc.  
2. **RWA Institutionalization Barriers. Overcoming manual interventions and complex regulatory requirements.**  
   Institutional adoption of RWAs on blockchain requires robust regulatory compliance, permission infrastructure built on public chains, allowing interoperability with traditional financial systems, and proven security and governance. Cardano must address these barriers to gain the trust of institutional investors and asset issuers.  
3. **Ecosystem fragmentation and lack of credible mainstream projects to attract liquidity and interest from both new and old users.**  
   Given the lack of notable global projects building upon Cardano, challenges for seamless integration between DeFi protocols, RWA tokenization platforms, and institutional-grade infrastructure (e.g., custody solutions, KYC/AML frameworks) hinders Cardano’s ability to provide a unified ecosystem for RWAs, upon which the Cardano institutional ecosystem can rally around.

### Who we are

DigiFT is a regulated platform for institutional-grade tokenized RWAs, licensed by Tier-1 regulators like the Monetary Authority of Singapore (RMO, CMS) and with Hong Kong SFC approval-in-principle. Backed by global financial issuers such as UBS and Invesco. DigiFT has been building compliant infrastructure for tokenized securities since 2021, graduating from an 18-month MAS regulatory sandbox in Dec-2023 with full licenses as a Recognized Market Operator (RMO) and Capital Markets Services (CMS). In June 2025, DigiFT also secured approval from the Hong Kong SFC, establishing itself as the world’s first fully regulated multi-chain RWA exchange with live deployments on Ethereum, Arbitrum, Solana, Sui, and Ripple. DigiFT will be a new active technical contributing member to the Cardano on-chain community.

### DigiFT’s Core Features and Capabilities

1. **Licensed and regulated** by Singapore and HK authorities to provide issuance, trading,settlement, and instant liquidity pools (RTL)  
2. **RWA Smart Contract Driven**, public on public permissioned blockchain. Clients just need to whitelist their wallets to our smart contracts to purchase.  
3. **Non-Custodial**, we have the ability to scale horizontally across digital asset verticals. We grow with our institutional partners, we do not compete with them.  
4. **On / off ramp stablecoins**, via USDC, USDT and in the future USA, via yield bearing on- chain RWA securities.  
5. **Instant Liquidity**, DigiFT is authorized to provide instant redemption via 3rd parties,including GSR and via AMM stablecoin pools.  
6. **Use Case builders / advocates**, DigiFT is at the forefront to deliver RWA use cases for branded yield bearing issuer assets.

**Our Team prides itself to delivering world class:**

* **Multi-asset manager marketplace,** institutional-grade infrastructure trusted by UBS and Invesco, and others AM’s, for deployment and distribution of tokenised security tokens  
* **Fiat and stablecoin native:** DigiFT is able to accept both fiat currency and stablecoin for subscription and redemption. We expect more stablecoins to list on our platform, allowing the stablecoins instant access to multiple branded AM names, avoiding painstaking one-by-one negotiation with each asset manager.  
* **Secure multi-chain support:** ‘plug and play’ API integrations, hosted on Alibaba Cloud. DigiFT is smart contract driven, and we have good relationships with the foundations to bring both AM’s and stablecoins, natively on-chain, closer to where their community builders are.

By funding this initiative, Cardano positions itself to solve these bottlenecks through **DigiFT’s integration as the core of its institutional RWA strategy, providing a critical cross section of regulated on-chain distribution capability and being built as a RWA smart contract platform, built and deployed on Cardano blockchain.**

# Rationale

### Executive summary

The DigiFT Institutional RWA Integration initiative will execute a strategic deployment plan, using the requested 6M ada to:

* **Develop and test Plutus smart contracts** to support primary market functions (RWA token issuance, subscription, redemption, instant redemption) and secondary market functions  
* **Integrate DigiFT with the Cardano blockchain**, including on-chain data scanning, transaction broadcasting, and interaction with Cardano-native smart contracts. Adapt frontend UI to support Cardano wallets.  
* **Stablecoin Integration (USDA)**: Direct work with USDA, enable RWA token subscription and redemption using USDA with 1:1 conversion.  
* **Security & Audit**: Conduct 3rd party security audits to ensure compliance and contract safety.  
* **Instant Liquidity Pool:** Build and develop instant liquidity pool, providing instant redemption  
* **Regulatory Compliance:** Licensing, KYC / AML infra integration, Legal reviews  
* **Marketing & Partnerships:**  
  * Builder Competition / Hackathons - create an incentive to generate use case proposals from the community to generate traffic on the products, bring contributors. Organizing and facilitating workshops related to key explorations of the products.  
  * Promote Cardano’s significant step into RWA Assets, immediately accessing DigiFT’s institutional assets, UBS, CMBI and Invesco and others…  
  * Introduction to TradFi institutional partners considering L1 blockchains to deploy upon;including B2B Crypto institutions, custodians, CEX's, wallet providers of DigiFT institutions building on ADA.
