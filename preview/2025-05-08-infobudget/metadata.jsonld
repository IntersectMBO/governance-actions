    "abstract": "On behalf of Intersect and the Budget committee, this proposes a Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget of ###M Ada, which falls within the current community-approved Net Change Limit of 350 million ada for 2025 (from the start of Epoch 532 to the conclusion of Epoch 604). This budget is comprised of ## proposals that cover maintenance, development, marketing, innovation and governance work for the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem. To arrive at this budget, Intersect facilitated a community budget submission process, with on-chain polling to assess and validate DRep support using the Ekklesia platform. 3.8bn ada voting stake participated, representing xx% of active delegated stake. Any project that received >50% support by stake from DReps participating in the budget drafting process have been included in this budget Info Action.\n\nThis budget represents an aggregate  allocation from the Cardano treasury that *may* be withdrawn, in one or more installments, subject to satisfaction of contractually negotiated milestones and further final approval in one or more Treasury Withdrawal info actions, from the Cardano Treasury throughout the period during which the current Net Change Limit is in effect. All proposals listed below have requested Intersect as their Administrator who will administer and oversee the use of funds from Cardano Blockchain treasury withdrawals pursuant to this budget.",
    "motivation": "The 2025 budget created through Cardano Community and DRep participation is designed to **keep Cardano secure, competitive and growing during the next 12 months of Cardano self-governance** while staying within the currently community-approved Net Change Limit of **350 million** ada that expires on [DATE].

Note, while we are referring to this as the 2025 budget, the actual budget period will run from the date that the budget is approved by the requisite number of DReps through [DATE]\n\n**Bottom line for DReps:** the 2025 budget is motivated by a single question—*“What mix of spending most efficiently turns Cardano’s product roadmap into tangible adoption and long-term resilience, without overspending the treasury?”* The allocations above reflect the community’s best answer, informed by 2024 cost data, public feedback and strategic modelling. Your vote determines whether this plan — and the development & initiatives it unlocks—moves forward.",
	  "rationale": "The 2025 budget process provides a balance between **strategic planning** and **inclusive governance**, ensuring critical ecosystem needs are funded with community approval. The rationale for its structure can be understood in several key components and workflow stages:\n\n1. **Proposal Submission & Consolidation** – Intersect’s Budget Committee aggregated funding proposals from across the ecosystem, including those developed by seven Intersect committees (spanning technical, product, governance, marketing and community domains) and an **open call** for proposals from any Cardano contributor. This dual intake (committee “block budgets” alongside community-driven proposals) ensured that both top-down roadmap priorities and bottom-up innovation needs were captured in the budget pipeline. All submissions followed a standardized format (problem statement, benefits, alignment to Cardano’s roadmap, cost, etc.) to enable fair evaluation. Intersect did not restrict who could apply – even non-Intersect members could submit to the process – and its committees could provide feedback to strengthen proposals before they reached DReps.\n2. **Community Signaling (before the budget info action)** – To gauge early support, DReps and ada owners signalled preferences on the submitted proposals using governance tools (initially the Cardano GovTool, and later an improved polling tool called **Ekklesia** for better user experience). This signalling phase let the community indicate which proposals merited inclusion in the on-chain budget info action. Only proposals that achieved a **broad support threshold** ( >50% approval in the signaling vote) advanced to the budget info action for formal vote. Community signaling ensured community priorities emerged organically and filtered out low-consensus items before any on-chain governance action, strengthening respect for DRep authority in determining the budget’s content. (Of course any proposal that did not meet this threshold can nevertheless be submitted by the proposer in a separate, future budget info action.)\n3. **On-Chain Budget Approval (DRep voting on the budget info action)** – Proposals that met the above threshold have then been packaged into this **Budget Info Action** for formal ratification. The **Cardano Constitution’s Article IV** requires all treasury withdrawals that are made to give effect to an approved budget must be within a community-approved **Net Change Limit (NCL)**, and applicable to the  approved budget. Therefore, this budget has been constructed to be below the current NCL of 350 trillion lovelace (350 million ada).DReps vote to ratify the budget knowing that the sum of all approved funding to be disbursed in  cannot exceed the NCL during the 12-month period covered by the NCL.\n4. **Treasury Withdrawal & Oversight** – Once a budget info action passes, the next step is executing one or more Treasury Withdrawal governance actions to release funds for the approved proposals. Intersect, acting as the designated administrator, then oversees disbursement of these funds to the respective proposal teams and vendors. Importantly, the process incorporates robust oversight mechanisms: funds are held in a multi-signature smart contract with multiple authorized signers (Intersect, auditors, and other appointed organizations Needs to be fleshed out) and in most cases, disbursements will be subject to satisfaction of negotiated milestones and periodic audits as overseen by Intersect.This arrangement can pause or halt payments if issues arise (e.g. breach of contract or failure to meet milestones), adding accountability. It also enables transparent tracking of expenditures – the community can monitor payments on-chain, achieving a high level of transparency in how treasury money is spent. Intersect’s committees continue to play an advisory role post-approval by monitoring progress, reporting on milestones and budget usage, and providing subject-matter oversight to ensure funds are used as intended. This stage closes the loop, enforcing that funded projects deliver value and that any unused or misused funds can be caught by the oversight process.  In cases of breaches of contract by vendors, Intersect expects to have the right to claw back funds that will be reverted to the Cardano treasury.  Equally, any funds remaining undisbursed at the end of the NCL period will revert back to the Cardano treasury.\n\nEach component of this workflow was chosen to address specific needs. **Community-first decision making** is ensured by the DRep signaling and voting, embodying Cardano’s principle of decentralized governance. **Strategic alignment** comes from involving DReps, the Cardano community and Intersect committees and by referencing the Cardano product roadmap, so that core infrastructure and maintenance needs are not overlooked. The **Net Change Limit** provides economic prudence, preventing the ecosystem from over-allocating resources beyond what the treasury can sustain. Finally, the introduction of **smart-contract-based fund management** and a defined administrator role reflects a commitment to transparency and constitutional compliance – as mandated by the Cardano Constitution, budget administration should leverage blockchain tools to the extent possible for oversight. In summary, the rationale is to create a budget process that is inclusive, structured, and secure: all stakeholders can participate, decisions follow a clear constitutional process, and checks and balances are in place to maintain trust in how funds are allocated and used.\n\nThe provisions set forth in the Cardano Constitution state that the approval of a Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem budget requires a threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting DRep stake and that Constitutional Committee members shall record a vote on-chain that sets forth their opinion as to whether the proposed budget, if it were to be implemented in the form contained in the “Info” action, would violate this Constitution. Therefore, this Budget Info Action will be considered passed with a DREp vote of greater than 50% by lovelace and a Constitutional Committee vote of at least 5 of 7 members.",
