    "abstract": "On behalf of Intersect and the Cardano Budget Committee, this Budget Info Action proposes a Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget of 275,269,340 aAda, which falls within the current community-approved Net Change Limit of ₳350M ada for 2025 (from the start of Epoch 532 to the conclusion of Epoch 604). This budget comprises 39 proposals that support maintenance, development, marketing, innovation, and governance initiatives within the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem.\n\nTo arrive at this budget, Intersect facilitated a community budget submission process, using live DRep stake to assess and validate support through the Ekklesia platform. More than ₳3.8B ada in voting stake participated, representing over 70% of actively delegated stake (excluding auto-delegation options). A total of 194 proposals were submitted as part of Intersect’s coordination efforts. Projects that received over 50% support by stake from participating DReps, and named Intersect as their Administrator, have been included in this Budget Info Action. Of the 194 proposals submitted, 40 met the required threshold, and 39 of these named Intersect as their Administrator.\n\nThis budget represents an aggregate allocation from the Cardano Treasury that may be withdrawn in one or more installments, subject to the satisfaction of contractually negotiated milestones and terms, and final approval via one or more Treasury Withdrawal governance actions. All proposals listed below have requested Intersect as their Administrator, who will oversee and administer the use of funds from Cardano Blockchain Treasury withdrawals in accordance with this budget. This includes leveraging blockchain technology such as smart contracts as per Article IV, section 2 in the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution.",

Note, while we are referring to this as the 2025 budget, the actual budget period will run from the date that the budget is approved by the requisite number of DReps through.\n\n**Bottom line for DReps:** This Budget Info Action formalizes the outcome of a community-driven budget process, facilitated by Intersect and based on live DRep support as signaled through the Ekklesia platform. Each proposal listed here received over 50% support by voting stake from participating DReps and requested Intersect as Administrator. This action seeks approval to recognize and authorize the aggregate treasury allocation in alignment with those outcomes.",
	  "rationale": "Intersect coordinated an open and inclusive process to help the Cardano community build a 2025 budget. This process gave individuals and teams a way to submit proposals that align with or support the product roadmap, which was approved on-chain earlier this year after being presented by the Product Committee. Proposals with clear community and DRep support were then prepared for formal on-chain approval as part of this budget.\n\n1. **Proposal Submission & Consolidation** - Intersect’s Budget Committee aggregated funding proposals from across the ecosystem, including those developed by seven Intersect committees (spanning technical, product, governance, marketing and community domains) and an open call for proposals from any Cardano contributor. This dual intake (committee “block budgets” alongside community-driven proposals) ensured that both top-down roadmap priorities and bottom-up innovation needs were captured in the budget pipeline. All submissions followed a standardized format (problem statement, benefits, alignment to Cardano’s roadmap, cost, etc.) to enable fair evaluation. Intersect did not restrict who could apply – non-Intersect members could submit to the process – and its committees could provide feedback to strengthen proposals before they reached DReps.\n2. **Community Signaling (before the budget info action)** - To gauge early support, DReps and ada owners signalled preferences on the submitted proposals using governance tools (initially the Cardano GovTool, and later an improved polling tool called Ekklesia for better user experience). This signalling phase let the community indicate which proposals merited inclusion in the on-chain budget info action. Only proposals that achieved a broad support threshold ( >50% approval in the signaling vote) advanced to the budget info action for formal vote. Community signaling ensured community priorities emerged organically and filtered out low-consensus items before any on-chain governance action, strengthening respect for DRep authority in determining the budget’s content. (Of course any proposal that did not meet this threshold can nevertheless be submitted by the proposer in a separate, future budget info action).\n3. **On-Chain Budget Approval (DRep voting on the budget info action)** - Proposals that met the above threshold have then been packaged into this Budget Info Action for formal ratification. The Cardano Constitution’s Article IV requires all treasury withdrawals that are made to give effect to an approved budget must be within a community-approved Net Change Limit (NCL), and applicable to the  approved budget. Therefore, this budget has been constructed to be below the current NCL of 350 trillion lovelace (350 mmillion ada).(Link to Current NCL) DReps vote to ratify the budget knowing that the sum of all approved funding to be disbursed in  cannot exceed the NCL during the 12-month period covered by the NCL.\n4. **Treasury Withdrawal & Oversight** - Once a budget info action passes, the next step is executing one or more Treasury Withdrawal governance actions to release funds for the approved proposals. Intersect, acting as the designated administrator, then oversees disbursement of these funds to the respective proposal teams and vendors. Importantly, the process incorporates robust oversight mechanisms: funds are held in a multi-signature smart contract with multiple authorized signers. This arrangement can pause or halt payments if issues arise (e.g. breach of contract or failure to meet milestones), adding accountability. It also enables transparent tracking of expenditures – the community can monitor payments on-chain, achieving a high level of transparency in how treasury money is spent. Intersect’s committees continue to play an advisory role post-approval by monitoring progress, reporting on milestones and budget usage, and providing subject-matter oversight to ensure funds are used as intended. This stage closes the loop, enforcing that funded projects deliver value and that any unused or misused funds can be caught by the oversight process.  In cases of breaches of contract by vendors, Intersect expects to have the right to claw back funds that will be reverted to the Cardano treasury.  Equally, any funds remaining undisbursed at the end of the NCL period will revert back to the Cardano treasury.\n\nEach component of this workflow was chosen to address specific needs. Community-first decision making is ensured by the DRep signaling and voting, embodying Cardano’s principle of decentralized governance. Strategic alignment comes from involving DReps, the Cardano community and Intersect committees and by referencing the Cardano product roadmap, so that core infrastructure and maintenance needs are not overlooked. The Net Change Limit provides economic prudence, preventing the ecosystem from over-allocating resources beyond what the treasury can sustain. Finally, the introduction of smart-contract-based fund management and a defined administrator role reflects a commitment to transparency and constitutional compliance – as mandated by the Cardano Constitution, budget administration should leverage blockchain tools to the extent possible for oversight. In summary, the rationale is to create a budget process that is inclusive, structured, and secure: all stakeholders can participate, decisions follow a clear constitutional process, and checks and balances are in place to maintain trust in how funds are allocated and used.\n\nThe provisions set forth in the Cardano Constitution state that the approval of a Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem budget requires a threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting DRep stake and that Constitutional Committee members shall record a vote on-chain that sets forth their opinion as to whether the proposed budget, if it were to be implemented in the form contained in the “Info” action, would violate this Constitution. Therefore, this Budget Info Action will be considered passed with a DRep vote of greater than or equal to 50% +1 lovelace and a Constitutional Committee vote of at least 5 of 7 members.",
