## Title

Budget: ₳3,600,000 for Building Cardano’s Communications Blueprint

## Abstract

Cardano stands at a decisive moment in its evolution. Nearly a decade of deliberate, peer-reviewed development has created one of the world’s most robust, research-driven ecosystems.

As Cardano progresses into the execution arc defined by the current draft Cardano 2030 Strategic Plan, the ecosystem’s voice must match its technical achievements and the maturity of its technology. Clear, evidence-based communication is essential to inspire developers, attract enterprise adoption, and demonstrate credible leadership in secure, sustainable, decentralized innovation. Without a grounded understanding of how Cardano is perceived, whether by the media or developers, enterprises, institutions and emerging market communities, the community risks relying on assumptions rather than insight for communications decision-making.

This proposal by [Wachsman](https://wachsman.com/), establishes an integrated intelligence and communications framework to reinforce Cardano’s position as the world’s most trusted and future-ready blockchain network. Through a data-driven blend of competitor benchmarking, audience mapping, sentiment analysis, and narrative validation, Wachsman will help the ecosystem understand and shape the global perception of Cardano with precision and authenticity.

Anchored in the Cardano 2030 Strategic Plan’s mandate to drive real-world utility, stimulate on-chain economic activity, and establish Cardano as a trusted, censorship-resistant infrastructure, the program translates insight into consistent, measurable action. Every narrative, campaign activation, and audience touchpoint is intentionally shaped to reinforce Cardano’s evolution into a platform delivering widespread utility, credible enterprise and government adoption, and ecosystem economic sustainability. This ensures Cardano’s communications function to not only advance perception but directly support the ecosystem’s progress toward meaningful transactions, active participation, and long-term revenue growth well beyond 2030\.

With this Budget Info Action, we aim to transparently share direction and gauge broad community support. If positively received, it will enable the submission of a follow-up Treasury Withdrawal governance action. The funds from this action will be managed by Intersect, contingent on milestone-based progress.

## Motivation

### Why This Matters

The current work being conducted by the Product Committee at Intersect on a Cardano 2030 Strategic Plan emphasizes that achieving utility and ecosystem self-sufficiency requires clearer recognition of Cardano’s strengths. While the ecosystem’s technology is mature and purpose-built for secure, censorship-resistant coordination for the real-world, perception trails reality. Other competing Layer-1s often win mindshare, frequently out-communicating Cardano rather than out-innovating, shaping public discourse with greater speed and consistency.

To accelerate adoption and strengthen trust, Cardano needs more than marketing. It needs market intelligence and a strategic communications approach. A clear, data-driven understanding of how Cardano is perceived across audiences, markets, and media is essential to build a unified narrative that reflects both its values and its vision. This proposal delivers that foundation, transforming scattered perception into coordinated strategy.

### Why Us

[Wachsman](https://wachsman.com/) is a global communications consultancy that has supported blockchain and Web3 pioneers since 2015\. With teams across APAC, EMEA and the US, we have guided the world’s leading Layer 1 ecosystems, financial infrastructure projects, and Web3 innovators through phases of high-growth transformation – helping them translate complex technology into strategic adoption drivers and credible, evidence-based storytelling.

We specialize in building full-spectrum programs that bridge research and execution, encompassing:

* **Market and audience research:** Uncovering how developers, institutions, regulators and users perceive ecosystem narratives.  
* **Narrative-building and messaging frameworks:** Translating insights into clear, differentiated value propositions.  
* **Strategic communications and campaign design:** Driving consistent visibility and engagement across regions.  
* **Brand and sentiment analytics:** Providing continuous feedback loops that inform future decision making.

Our work enables ecosystems to move beyond assumptions. We design and execute communication strategies and campaigns that are grounded in truth, shaped by data, and aligned with community purpose.

## ***Experience with Layer 1 Ecosystems***

Wachsman has delivered integrated market research and communications programs for leading Layer 1 protocols and infrastructure projects, including:

* **Global perception audits:** For a major Layer 1 protocol, we conducted cross-market sentiment tracking and discourse mapping, revealing gaps between public perception and technical reality. The results informed a unified narrative that rebuilt developer trust and stakeholder confidence.  
* **Persona and audience mapping**: For Web3 infrastructure platforms, we identified distinct audience motivations, friction points, and trust triggers, forming the basis for high-performing spokesperson programs and campaign strategies.  
* **Competitive benchmarking:** For a fast-growing ecosystem, we mapped overlaps across Ethereum, Solana, and Polkadot narratives to identify whitespace and refine unique differentiation.  
* **Brand health tracking:** Using linguistic AI and media analytics, we built dashboards measuring narrative velocity, share-of-voice, and thematic traction and penetration, enabling leadership to stay ahead of market shifts.

These programs consistently deliver the same outcome: ecosystems reclaim narrative control, strengthen reputation, and accelerate adoption through clarity, consistency, and credibility.

***Bringing Ecosystem Insight to Life: The Midnight ‘Glacier Drop’***  
In 2025, Wachsman partnered with Midnight, a privacy-enhancing blockchain and partner chain to Cardano, to develop the strategy behind ‘Glacier Drop’ – one of the most ambitious community engagement campaigns ever executed in Web3. The objective: achieve one million verified participants across eight blockchain ecosystems.

Over 18 months, Wachsman led a research-to-activation model built on data, dialogue, and iteration:

* **Research**: Monthly sentiment analysis, community mapping, channel analysis and behavioral insight studies across Cardano, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, XRP Ledger, BNB Chain, Avalanche and Brave communities  
* **Strategy:** Messaging and channel frameworks were customized to each ecosystem’s motivations and friction points, ensuring that communications aligned with unique community psychographics  
* **Execution:** A phased campaign spanning pre-, during- and post-launch stages integrated thought leadership, KOL engagement, social strategy and real-time feedback tracking

The result: [over 2.4 billion NIGHT tokens claimed, representing more than 10% of total supply](https://midnight.network/blog/glacier-drop-claims-surpass-2-4-billion-night-tokens?). This is a milestone that exceeded participation goals and demonstrated how evidence-based communications can turn insight into impact.

This campaign showcased Wachsman’s ability to translate intelligence into measurable growth within the Cardano ecosystem. The same principles underpin this proposal: combining rigorous analysis with strategic storytelling to activate participation, build trust, and strengthen Cardano’s position as a global leader in blockchain innovation.

***Cardano’s Strategic Imperative: Intelligence-to-Action in 2026 and Beyond***  
As Cardano moves into its next growth phase, assumption-driven marketing will no longer suffice. Competing Layer 1s are leveraging data analytics and media optimization to shape narratives faster than ever. To sustain momentum, Cardano must build its communications strategy on real-time insight, understanding where it stands, what differentiates it, and how to mobilize its community voice globally.

Wachsman proposes a phased, intelligence-to-action model, ensuring that each stage builds on verified insights and aligns with Cardano’s 2030 vision.

**Phase 1: Intelligence Baseline**  
Wachsman begins with in-depth market and sentiment research to define the forces shaping perception across the Layer 1 ecosystem. Through qualitative interviews, community focus groups, and competitor benchmarking (including Ethereum, Solana, and Sui), the team will:

* Map how Cardano is perceived today by developers, institutions, regulators, and the public  
* Identify strategic positioning gaps and regional misalignments, including ecosystem priorities, audience motivations, and narrative stress-testing via focus groups  
* Quantify media and social sentiment, establishing a verifiable baseline for improvement

These insights serve as the foundation for Cardano’s resonant communications strategy and ensure that work is built on a foundation of data, not guesswork. Community tracking and go-to-market analysis will provide real-time insight loops, allowing messaging frameworks to evolve dynamically.

**Phase 2: Cardano’s Proof of Perception**  
With the intelligence base now established, Wachsman will measure how Cardano’s story performs in public discourse. Using proprietary brand health dashboards, the team will track visibility, tone, trust, and thematic penetration across earned media, social platforms, and search data.

Outputs include:

* **Competitive spokesperson resonance dashboard:** Mapping voice credibility and reach against key competitors, assessing where spokespersons sit on the volume and value axis, and identifying the coterie of voices that carry the most cachet in the digital assets sphere  
* **Quarterly brand health report (Baseline edition)**: Tracking share of voice, sentiment and brand recall to establish benchmarks to gauge Cardano’s standing as well as its overall narrative resilience and evolution.

Data-anchored insight transforms this phase into an operational pivot point, aligning narratives with verifiable metrics of trust and relevance. It sharpens Cardano’s communication strategy and primes its leadership, developer, and enterprise pipelines for synchronized activation in Phase 3\.

**Phase 3: Activating Insights-to-Execution Communications**  
With a validated intelligence base established, this phase turns research into momentum and execution.

Wachsman will deliver an integrated communications engine that brings together narrative development, strategic media engagement, thought leadership, and spokesperson activation, ensuring Cardano speaks with a single coordinated, credible voice across global markets, channels, and communities.

This is where insight becomes influence. Communications will no longer describe what Cardano builds, but articulate why it matters. This phase will aim to translate complex technological milestones into human relevance and regional resonance. Campaigns will spotlight the innovations most meaningful to developers, enterprises, and policy partners, while anticipating friction points through clear, trust-building narratives tailored to the local context.

Anchored in Cardano 2030 Strategic Plan and our proposed ‘**Build · Scale · Lead**’ communications approach, this phase converts insight into coordinated, measurable activation through the **Cardano Communications Playbook**.

Through flagship, signature activations, Wachsman will help Cardano showcase how its principles of governance, interoperability, and inclusion manifest in real-world impact. Each campaign will be localized and timed to key ecosystem moments, from Dev Day and industry conferences to governance milestones so as to consistently reinforce Cardano’s story across developer, enterprise, and community audiences.

Through proactive spokesperson and community leader enablement ahead of milestones, Cardano will project a consistent, authoritative presence that reflects not only its technological strength but its collective ambition to build an open, interoperable, and inclusive digital future. This integrated communications engine will unify global and regional messaging, empowering spokespeople, partners, and community contributors to tell one cohesive story: how Cardano is building the future, block by block.

**Phase 4: Knowledge Transfer & Community Handover**  
The final phase ensures that the insights, frameworks, and tools produced through this initiative become lasting infrastructure for the Cardano ecosystem.

In line with Cardano 2030 Strategic Plan’s emphasis on building ecosystem self-sufficiency, this phase translates the research, methodologies, and communications system into community stewardship. The outputs from this engagement will become an enduring shared capability that is owned, operated, and evolved by the ecosystem itself.

Wachsman will establish the **Cardano Research Hub**, a centralized, searchable repository housing all insights, narrative frameworks, and campaign toolkits developed throughout the engagement. This hub will serve as a living knowledge base accessible to ecosystem teams, SPOs, dApp projects, and community contributors, enabling them to refine their own communications and campaigns with evidence-based precision.

To embed these capabilities, Wachsman will conduct **a series of Community Intelligence Workshops and Knowledge Transfer Sessions** that train internal teams, ecosystem projects and partners to interpret insights, update datasets, and apply frameworks independently.

These workshops will draw directly from the ‘**Build · Scale · Lead**’ communications model, empowering contributors across regions to localize Cardano’s messaging while maintaining coherence with its global narrative.

This handover transforms an 18-month engagement into an enduring, self-sustaining resource. Cardano’s communications can then evolve with its technology and governance while preserving fidelity to its core mission: to build an open, inclusive, and interoperable digital economy.

***In Summary***  
Through this integrated approach, every milestone becomes an opportunity to shift perception, build belief, and grow Cardano’s ecosystem – region by region, and audience by audience. The intelligence infrastructure built through this initiative ensures that Cardano’s communications remain evidence-based, unified, and future-ready. By aligning research, storytelling, and community enablement, Cardano will move forward with a clear, holistic, data-driven communications strategy that grows stronger with each upgrade, partnership and innovation, ultimately solidifying its position as the world’s most trusted foundation for decentralized progress.
