# Schemas

The purpose of this directory is to store, JSONLD schemas Intersect will use
when submitting governance actions.

These are extensions to [CIP-100 | Governance Metadata](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-0100/README.md) which add new fields.

These definitions maybe discovered by the `@context` within Intersect submitted governance actions.

These schemas may live at the CIPs repository in the future.
