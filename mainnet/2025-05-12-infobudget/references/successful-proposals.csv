232,Catalyst 2025 Proposal by Input Output: Advancing Decentralised Community Innovation Funding & Infrastructure,inputoutput,Marketing & Innovation,Company,Input Output,iohk.io,United States,,,,X: @InputOutputHK @Catalyst\_onX @krissbaird,"Project Catalyst has become a cornerstone for decentralized innovation and ecosystem growth within Cardano. As participation increases and the demands of funding and governance become more complex, this proposal aims to address five key challenges necessary for Cardano’s continued growth, competitiveness, and decentralization:
1.  **Operational inefficiencies:** Catalyst currently depends on substantial manual oversight and coordination across its funding cycles. Without targeted investment in tooling and automation, operational overhead will remain high. Streamlining systems now lays the groundwork for a leaner, more cost-effective operation once this development roadmap concludes in 2026.
2.  **Low voter engagement:** While Catalyst sees higher voter engagement than most blockchain ecosystems, participation remains disproportionately low relative to the total ADA in circulation. This imbalance raises questions about how representative funding decisions truly are of the broader Cardano community.
3.  **Software limitations:** Fragmented tools and inconsistent user workflows create friction across the entire Catalyst journey - from proposal to review to vote to ongoing project-funding administration and transparent outcomes. This complexity deters newcomers and reduces the system’s inclusivity and scalability.
4.  **Voting power concentration:** A small number of high-stake wallets have the potential to dominate decision-making, leading to concerns around fairness and influence. Planned reforms like Quadratic Voting and DRep delegation are essential steps toward more equitable governance.
5.  **Catalyst’s early-stage focus:** While Catalyst excels at incubating early-stage ideas and pilot programs, its role is sometimes mistaken for a long-term funding source. Clarifying Catalyst as a launchpad for experimentation and industry adoption, while encouraging mature projects not focused on partnerships to seek alternative treasury channels—will help align expectations and optimize resource allocation","This proposal directly supports the goals outlined in the Cardano 2025 Roadmap, particularly in the following areas:
* **“L2 Expansion”** The Hermes engine advances the roadmap’s scalability and decentralization objectives by replacing the current federated side-chain infrastructure with a fully distributed, immutable ledger and peer-to-peer architecture built on IPFS, LibP2P, and WASM. Designed to decentralize DApps and off-chain business logic, Hermes enables Catalyst to post vote archives as rollups to Cardano L1, and will extend on-chain utility with additional artifacts such as role registrations (e.g., reviewers, moderators, milestone verifiers), proofs of achievement, and other Catalyst-related data.
* **""""Building Governance & Community Tools""""** By expanding Catalyst’s decentralized governance capabilities through Hermes and delivering a unified, accessible user experience for governance participation, this proposal strengthens the foundation for inclusive, community-led decision-making.
* **""""Enhancing On-chain Utility""""** The majority of resources (61m) will be distributed to the Cardano community in order to build applications and kickstart adoption initiatives, driving onchain transactions and Cardano based use-cases. Catalyst infrastructure will publish vote records and governance-related metadata—such as role registrations (reviewers, moderators, milestone verifiers), proofs of achievement, and other Catalyst data as rollups to Cardano L1, thereby expanding on-chain utility and ensuring transparent, verifiable participation. The integration of Cardano Native Token (CNT) support and the enablement of diversified funding streams foster real-world use cases and create new opportunities for builders across the ecosystem, driving further transactions and utility.","This proposal addresses the need for reliable ecosystem funding to support hundreds of Cardano builders and startups, alongside upgrading the core structural and operational limitations facing Catalyst, laying the foundation for its long-term sustainability and decentralization. Through these three interlinked workstreams: Catalyst Interface Development, Hermes Decentralized Infrastructure, and the execution of three Funding Rounds the return on investment for this proposal is measured in tangible, ecosystem-wide outcomes, including:
1.  **For the Ecosystem:** Significant reduction in operational costs, with potential savings of up to 50% in future Catalyst cycles from 2026 onward and broader and more meaningful community participation by strengthening Cardano’s decentralized innovation funding infrastructure with expanded governance functionality and funding flexibility, with support for multiple voting mechanics and the ability to participate using Cardano Native Tokens beyond ADA.
2.  **For Cardano Developers, Entrepreneurs, and Community Builders:** Continued assurance of community-led funding, giving hundreds of community builders the confidence to plan and scale their projects, supported by a trusted, experienced, and committed Catalyst operations team. ₳61 million to be deployed across three funding rounds, including the launch of a Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) initiative, designed to reward high-impact contributions that have already been delivered - even if not initially funded through a Catalyst vote. The results are increased support for early stage R&D, open-source, regional, and community-led initiatives, guided by more equitable and representative voting mechanisms.
3.  **For End Users :** Seamless, scalable, and accessible Catalyst infrastructure delivered through unified, device-agnostic interfaces lowering barriers to participation, particularly in mobile-first regions, enabled by enhanced user interfaces and experience and production-grade decentralized infrastructure powered by Hermes, replacing legacy federated systems with peer-to-peer architecture. The sum of these parts aligns directly with Cardano’s broader goals of decentralization, transparency, and system resilience. Plus the introduction of optionality between delegated and direct voting that improves governance legitimacy, with greater transparency, auditability, and resilience across funding and decision-making processes due to investment in interfaces and infrastructure.",It supports the product roadmap,Membership & Community Committee,,"Project Catalyst has emerged as a cornerstone of decentralized innovation and funding within the Cardano ecosystem. As a pioneering governance mechanism, Catalyst has enabled over three million on-chain decisions and the allocation of over ₳290 million to more than 2,000 projects in 114 countries. However, with growth comes complexity. As community participation, funding demand, and governance sophistication increase, so too does the need to address critical structural and operational challenges. This proposal lays out a coordinated plan to provide reliable ecosystem funding and to future-proof Catalyst through a set of transformative upgrades that supports the Cardano 2025 Roadmap and community-validated priorities across three core workstreams:

1.  **Catalyst Interface Design and Development for Diversified Funding Streams**
    * **Objective:** Reduce operating costs by up to 50% and increase both voting power and wallet participation by 30-50% minimum by improving accessibility across all devices and completing the unification of all the remaining components of the Catalyst user experience: combining ideation, proposal submission, community contributor roles (reviewing, moderating), voting, and project administration. For Catalyst, this means further design, development, and automation of user journeys and work flows for each type of Catalyst user experience.
    * **Outcome:** Unlock the full end-to-end Catalyst experience for community members using any device to reduce barriers to entry and boost adoption (especially in emerging markets with high rates of smartphone ownership vs desktop).
    * **Output:** This will deliver unified Catalyst interfaces covering complex Fund Operations and funding administration components. Leveraging existing UX design system for Catalyst App and Flutter for its cross-platform portability to move from desktop to device-agnostic optimization:
        * User-centric admin interfaces and dashboards. All proposals, reviewer data, evidence of milestone achievements, and impact reporting data is transparently and intuitively available so community members can track the development and progress of project proposals and teams they interact with.
        * User contribution and participation is tracked for reputation-score and incentives attributions
        * Diversified funding and decision-making beyond ADA with Cardano Native Tokens. Administration interfaces allow token issuers and co-funders to create additional funding opportunities such as match-funding and donations. CNT back-end development is already complete meaning Catalyst can index Cardano blockchain to take voting power attribution from any Cardano Native Token. Only interface design unleashes all this potential.
        * Streamlined milestone management: Proposal data seamlessly transfers into the statement of milestones via deep hooks to milestone module
        * Funding and contribution dashboards give users clear communications, receipts, and reputation surfaces
        * Automated assignments and forfeitures ensure reviewers are complying, timely, and accountable to service level agreements
        * Integrated impact data reporting and evaluation using standardized impact measurements
        * Design foundations for the integration of funding and resolution smart contracts
    * **Features:**

        * Legacy Integrations & Deployments: upgrade legacy tools and integrations to deep hook into concurrent programs
        * Mobile Wallet Connect Research: understand existing solutions and challenges to enable mobile wallet connections
        * Advanced Design Research: test and validate approaches to translating desktop UX to mobile and deep hooks
        * Cardano Native Token Support: index Cardano holdings and make them available to Catalyst tools and interfaces
        * Self-Service Campaign Portal: Provide scalable tools for campaign configuration, deployment, and management
        * Device agnostic development: address other platform-specific requirements to ensure seamless mobile platform integration.
        * Deployment Pipeline: enable seamless CI/CD app deployment, without reliance on other teams
        * Account Restoration: allow a user to easily restore an existing account to a new device

2.  **Production-Grade Decentralised Catalyst Infrastructure via Hermes**
    * **Objective:** Advance the decentralisation, scalability, and auditability of Project Catalyst by delivering a rigorously stress tested implementation of Hermes to replace federated infrastructure with a fully distributed, peer-to-peer system. This includes enabling parallel voting events, secure Cardano-based vote casting, and public auditability of historic voting data that eliminates reliance on Web2 infrastructure services, empowering open innovation and ecosystem governance.
    * **Outcome:** maturing the state of the art of the Project Catalyst technology stack beyond the existing proof of concept and delivering production-ready Catalyst infrastructure using a fully distributed database and immutable ledger, configurable administration interfaces, eliminating reliance on a federated side-chain and small number of nodes while maintaining many artefacts are published to Cardano mainchain.
    * **Output:** Enhanced scalability and flexibility of Catalyst governance: multiple funding rounds using multiple tokens can run concurrently or overlap, dramatically increasing the system's utility and responsiveness. Stronger security and voter confidence through direct blockchain-based verification and vote casting, reducing trust assumptions. Full decentralisation of Catalyst infrastructure : no dependency on federated servers or Web2 storage, reducing censorship risks and increasing resilience. Greater transparency and auditability : historic voting data is verifiable, immutable, and accessible through distributed networks Developer empowerment : Builders can deploy secure, complex, and custom applications like governance mechanisms on Hermes with minimal barriers via IPFS and WebAssembly.
    * **Features:**
        * Upgrade WASM Engine to latest Wasm Component Model required for Hermes Application Logic.
        * Enhance WASM module Linker to support partial linking for modules which do not contain all events, or use all functions provided by the Hermes runtime.
        * Add events for WASM driven validation of data published over IPFS Pub/Sub or the DHT.
        * Make Hermes engine execute multiple WASM modules in parallel for performance and scalability testing
        * Implement a generalised solution to uniformly manage system resources.
        * Hermes package can read data directly from IPFS, not from a local copy downloaded from IPFS.
        * Enable execution of Hermes applications from an IPFS link, not only a locally present application.
        * Implement cryptography for 2024’s applied research into Quadratic Voting and Time-Weighted Stake models

3.  **F14-F16 Catalyst Funding Rounds, Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF), Fund Operations**

This strategic approach delivers broad impact—strengthening Cardano’s global research leadership and producing tangible outputs such as academic papers, technical recommendations, and validated prototypes. Commercializing deep technologies like Web3 cannot rely solely on market demand; it depends on sustained scientific and technical excellence. Without proactive investment, valuable opportunities may be lost. Critical infrastructure must also undergo rigorous research and validation, as flaws can compromise network security or endanger user assets. By focusing on high-potential R&D areas, this initiative builds a strong foundation for innovation, accelerates time to market, and drives meaningful economic and societal outcomes.","Proposal supports the following areas of the Product Roadmap: Developer / User Experience, Scaling the L1 Engine, Architectural Excellence, Leios, L2 Expansion, SPO Incentive Improvements, Multiple Node Implementations, Incoming Liquidity, Programmable Assets","Input Output Research (IOR) aims to deliver a pipeline of 20+ high-impact research initiatives annually, each supported by peer-reviewed papers and artefacts. From this pipeline, 6 initiatives will be selected for technical validation through a rigorous, multidisciplinary process involving community, customer, and IO’s R&D team.

Research is committed to academic excellence, with each research paper typically requiring two years due to the complexity and peer-review process. We will maintain an annual output of at least 20 peer-reviewed publications and artefacts that contribute meaningfully to both the Cardano ecosystem and the broader research community. To maximize impact, we are enhancing visibility through targeted dissemination to boost citations, foster collaboration, and solidify Cardano’s reputation in blockchain R&D.

Technology validation (previously called Innovation) streams translate research into practice, delivering six validated outputs annually—including technical reports, formal specifications, prototypes, simulations, Cardano Problem Statements (CPSs), and Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs). Prototypes and technical documentation will provide in-depth analysis and serve as critical foundations for product development within the Cardano ecosystem. CIPs, in particular, promote transparency and community-driven evolution, addressing key challenges and helping guide Cardano’s strategic advancement.

To date, Input Output Research has played a catalytic role in growing Cardano into a multi-billion-dollar blockchain. The multi-year, funnel-based approach outlined is designed to strengthen the foundation for Cardano’s continued growth and leadership, ensuring a steady pipeline of high-impact, globally relevant opportunities that address the most significant challenges in blockchain.",It supports the product roadmap,Product Committee,"The Cardano Vision and 2025 Work Program proposals are the outcome of 18 months dedicated research and planning. Over the past six months, these proposals have been collaboratively shaped and approved by the Intersect Product Committee. This process included regular stakeholder engagement through committee meetings, X Spaces and broader socialization efforts.

Notably, in a recent Governance Info Action for the Cardano Vision roadmap, 64.5% of participating DReps voted in favor of supporting the vision (248 Yes, 9 No, and 25 Abstain), demonstrating strong community alignment and support for the product direction of the Cardano ecosystem.","The IOR proposal for Work Program 2025 consists of 20 research streams and 6 technology validation streams from Cardano Vision, a five-year program consisting of 34 research streams across 9 thematic focus areas. Over a five-year period, this funnel approach is expected to generate over 100 high-quality research outputs and provide the foundation for 30 or more technology validation streams, to be implemented into Cardano’s Testnet and Mainnet by engineers and developers from the Cardano community.

Problem Statement

As Cardano enters the age of Voltaire, governance is transitioning from a small number of founding organizations to a decentralized global community. While the introduction of a constitution and on-chain voting forms the structural backbone, these mechanisms alone are not enough to sustain a functional decentralized system. What’s needed in parallel is community-aligned coordination -  infrastructure that enables participation, promotes continuity, and supports informed decision-making across the network.

At present, Intersect is the only named Administrator, a role outlined in Cardano’s Constitution and connected to over 100 live proposals in the current budget cycle. Given the nascent stages of Cardano’s governance journey, this makes Intersect a critical component of governance execution — providing oversight, legal and operational accountability, and administrative support for proposal disbursement and monitoring.

Intersect is also responsible for the stewardship of Cardano’s core Haskell codebases, including the repositories that power the Cardano node. This role involves more than maintenance — it includes coordinating new releases, aligning contributors around engineering best practices, and ensuring that upgrades are ready for safe deployment. Intersect acts as a neutral facilitator in this process, helping translate new feature proposals from ecosystem vendors into stable, tested releases that can be confidently adopted across the network.

Intersect has played a central role in coordinating ecosystem-wide upgrades, including the successful deployment of the Chang and Plomin hard forks. These upgrades required aligning infrastructure providers, SPOs, dApps, and exchanges globally — a process demanding deep technical coordination, ecosystem trust, and communications capacity.

Beyond technical infrastructure, Intersect provides a collaborative space for governance to mature and grow, supporting over 30 working groups and eight elected committees made up of Cardano community members. These committees focus on key areas such as budgeting, product development, open source, membership, growth, and technical standards — offering non-binding recommendations and practical insight to on-chain actors like DReps and SPOs.

Without effective coordination, upgrades can become slower to deploy, Treasury processes harder to navigate, and community participation more fragmented. Intersect was created to help reduce these friction points - not to control them, but to support a smoother decentralized experience through transparency, pragmatism, and member-led infrastructure. While we still have room to grow, our purpose remains clear: to serve the ecosystem as a reliable enabler of Cardano’s decentralized future.
","This proposal supports the 2025 product roadmap, and includes working towards a longer-term 2030 vision. Also aligns with governance support goals, including budgeting, technical coordination, and roadmap facilitation.","This proposal enables Intersect to continue providing essential infrastructure, coordination, and governance support for Cardano during a pivotal 12-month period from June 2025 to June 2026.

Intersect exists to serve as a neutral, nonprofit coordination layer that bridges decentralized governance and decentralized infrastructure. Our mission is not to direct the network, but to enable it. By stewarding core systems, supporting community-led processes, and facilitating safe, transparent delivery.

Specifically, this proposal will fund Intersect to:

1. Steward core infrastructure
- Maintain and govern the open-source Cardano node repositories, including the Haskell codebases
- Coordinate and release upgrades proposed by ecosystem contributors, ensuring safe deployment, roadmap alignment, and stakeholder readiness
- Provide stability and continuity across key engineering practices and upgrade cycles

2. Execute the Administrator role
- Continue fulfilling the responsibilities of the “Administrator” role defined in the Constitution. Intersect is currently listed as an Administrator on over 100 budget proposals currently
- Provide contract and oversight support, including proposal vetting, operational execution, smart contract development, and compliance monitoring
- Act as a reliable counterparty for Treasury-funded initiatives, offering arbitration routes while supporting increased transparency and decentralization

3. Support participation and coordination
- Deliver stipends to elected committee members — beginning formal recognition of their time and expertise and 
- Facilitate an election process to confirm a new Constitutional Committee 
- Provide professional operational and coordination support to 8 committees and 30+ working groups
- Provide through our members, onboarding, tools, and resources for DReps, SPOs, and the Constitutional Committee

4. Facilitate roadmap and budget processes
- Via the Product Committee, facilitating product roadmap development and long-term ecosystem vision
- Rebuilding a budget process for 2026 and coordinating the delivery and on-chain submission of a 2026 budget 
- Conceptualize and being to operationalize a scalable RFP process for committee-aligned budget proposals (example the Open Source Committee proposal)

5. Expand Ecosystem Capacity
- Support the emergence of new MBOs, associations, and working groups
- Recognize and reinforce the need for multiple Administrators in the future to support a plural and scalable governance model

Intersect’s nonprofit status provides the right structure for these activities and we commit that any unused funds will be returned to the Treasury, and the requested ₳15.75m is a capped allocation, not a guaranteed disbursement. Funds will be released quarterly, pegged to live ADA/USD exchange rates, and tracked through transparent public reporting.

This proposal reflects the direction Intersect is now committed to: clearer scope, radical accountability, and coordination that serves — not controls — Cardano’s governance and development.",It supports the product roadmap,Membership & Community Committee,"Intersect currently supports:

- 1,900 members and 2,800 associates across 74 countries
- 6 regional hubs (LATAM, Japan, Sri Lanka, Europe, Africa, USA)
- 30+ working groups and 8 elected committees

Intersect is also the listed administrator on over 100 community proposals submitted through the budget cycle.","Since its inception, Intersect has played a critical role in Cardano's decentralized transition, including:

- Stewarding the Chang and Plomin upgrades
Facilitating Cardano’s first Constitution
- Managing the 2025 roadmap and budget cycle
Supporting SPOs, DRePs, and CC participants
- Organizing global workshops, hubs, and governance events
- Maintaining the Cardano core Haskell codebases through its Open Source Office

Intersect will now not seek retrospective funding for our 2025 work to date. This request covers June 2025 to June 2026.

Request: ₳15.75m allocation ($7.875M USD equivalent)
- Amount is an allocation, funding is based on USD and to be disbursed quarterly based on exchange rate
- $500K earmarked for elected committee member stipends
- Any surplus will be swept back into the Treasury
","- Continued participation by DRePs, SPOs, and members

- Active collaboration with elected committees and hubs
","Intersect is committed to long-term sustainability beyond the initial funding period. As a very accessible member-based organization, we are deliberately structured to keep barriers to entry low welcoming contributors from across the Cardano ecosystem, regardless of their size or formal affiliation. This inclusive approach allows us to coordinate work across a wide network of individual contributors and community-driven initiatives, but it also means we cannot rely solely on high membership dues or private funding models, as some traditional open source foundations do.

Given our coordinating role and public mandate, Treasury funding remains the most viable option currently available to support Intersect’s essential infrastructure, governance, and support services. However, we also recognize the importance of reducing long-term reliance on the Treasury where possible.

Looking ahead, we aspire to diversify our revenue over time in ways that are consistent with our values - through partnerships, value-aligned services, and expanded membership contributions. While Treasury support may remain a key part of Intersect’s model, our aim is to strengthen sustainability and resilience so we can continue serving the Cardano community well into the future.","Always-on initiatives

Important note: This budget request is an allocation, not a guaranteed expenditure.

More on strategic changes as of Apr 25, 2025:

Under Intersect’s new direction, we are prioritizing lean operations and financial discipline. As a not-for-profit organization, Intersect is committed to using Treasury funds responsibly and efficiently. Resources will only be drawn down when necessary, and certain budgeted components such as legal costs related to contract arbitration may not be utilized at all. Our budget request will now not seek retrospective funding, providing a necessary clean slate. This proposal seeks funding from June 25’ to June 26’.

In the short to mid-term, we are also implementing a full scale transition plan to reduce our reliance on external consultants by hiring experienced and talented contributors from within the Cardano community - reinforcing our commitment to member-led delivery and ecosystem sustainability. Our team costs in 2024 amounted to $5.33 million. Acknowledging the need for additional capacity in our Administrator role, and in light of the cost savings described above and detailed further down, we are working towards a leaner operation.

Payments will be disbursed quarterly based on live ADA/USD exchange rates to reflect real-time value, likely resulting in less ada being distributed over the course of our 12-month funding ask. Any unspent funds at the end of the budget cycle will be returned to the Treasury.

729,Cardano Builder DAO,logan,Marketing & Innovation,Group,,,,Cardano Builder DAO,DAO,"This is a group of some of Cardano's largest and most used products/services. Including: NMKR, ADA Handle, Dex Hunter, Flux Point Studios, Tap Tools, Wanchain, Drip Dropz, NFTCDN.io, Tokeo, Clarity, Xerberus, Iagon",X: builder__dao,"This proposal seeks to address the lack of dedicated, sustainable financial support and strategic oversight for functioning dApps that drive real usage, transaction volume, and Total Value Locked (TVL) on the Cardano blockchain.
 
 
While Cardano has mechanisms for new protocol development and early-stage funding, there is currently no infrastructure specifically designed to financially support application-layer projects that are already live on mainnet and which are driving Cardano’s current user activity. Without targeted support, these projects risk stagnation, limiting Cardano’s broader adoption and on-chain ecosystem growth. 
 
To reach mass adoption, Cardano needs to better support launched projects; this proposal aims to ensure that established builders with launched dApps can continue to build on Cardano.","This proposal directly supports Cardano’s Product Roadmap by ensuring that the network’s technical innovations, such as Leios, Hydra, Midgard, and programmable assets, are actually leveraged and integrated into user-facing applications. While the roadmap outlines the infrastructure and performance goals for Cardano’s core systems, CB DAO ensures that these innovations are translated into real-world utility through Cardano’s high-impact dApps.

The vision of the roadmap states “By improving developer experience through enhanced APIs, robust tooling, and a focus on decentralization, Cardano aims to empower developers to build innovative and impactful applications.” The Cardano builder DAO members are the projects and services are the developers building these impactful applications.

CB DAO complements the roadmap in the following ways:

Drives Ecosystem Growth and Adoption:
By funding projects that increase on-chain activity, TVL, and active user metrics, CB DAO activates the foundational improvements in Cardano’s scalability (Leios), throughput (Hydra), and settlement speed (Peras).

Accelerates Developer and User Experience Goals:
CB DAO empowers developers already on Cardano with resources to scale their products and integrate cutting-edge features like programmable assets, partner chains, and decentralized stablecoins.

Fosters Real-World Implementation of Layer 2 and Modular Innovations:
As Hydra, Midgard, and other L2 solutions mature, the dApps funded by CB DAO will be positioned to be first in line to adopt these tools, serving as the deployment layer for innovations that otherwise risk being underutilized.

Aligns With Community Goals:
The community has prioritized usability, interoperability, and scalability. CB DAO helps deliver on those priorities by supporting applications that convert technical performance into tangible, user-accessible experiences.

Enables Feedback Loops:
Funded dApps generate critical data, including usage, system stress points, and adoption metrics, that inform future protocol improvements and roadmap decisions.

Bridging Infrastructure to Impact:
All CB DAO-funded projects are the interface between the protocol and its users. They are the builders turning Cardano’s research and engineering milestones into accessible tools, marketplaces, financial products, and services. Without this layer, innovations like Hydra, Leios, or programmable assets risk becoming unused capabilities rather than the backbone of a thriving decentralized economy.
","If implemented, this proposal will directly benefit Cardano dApp developers, the broader ecosystem of users, and ADA holders by creating a reliable funding structure focused on sustained adoption, utility, and on-chain economic activity. 
 
Demonstrated value to the Cardano Community includes:
* **Increased On-Chain Activity**: Providing financial support to launched projects with real users and measurable transactions will grow Cardano's usage metrics, a key indicator of network health and success.
* **Higher TVL and Ecosystem Stickiness**: By supporting projects that retain user assets on-chain, the DAO boosts Cardano’s DeFi footprint and TVL.
* **More Reliable Infrastructure & Products**: Developers gain access to capital that enables consistent product development, user support, and innovation.
* **Greater Visibility and Adoption**: Supporting high-impact applications increases Cardano's competitiveness in the broader Web3 landscape, attracting new users and developers.
* **Transparent ROI Tracking**: Funded projects must report KPIs like transaction counts, active users, and commit activity, enabling the community to clearly measure the impact and return on funding decisions.
* **Balance Ecosystem Funding Structure**: This purpose-built funding mechanism complements Project Catalyst by creating a clear delineation between the different development stages of projects, and where they should seek funding within the ecosystem. This enables Project Catalyst to be a more effective innovation engine as larger projects will not rely on Project Catalyst for funding.",It supports the product roadmap,Unsure,"This proposal is supported by 12 of Cardanos most used products and services including NMKR, ADA Handle, Dex Hunter, Flux Point Studios, Tap Tools, Wanchain, NFTCDN.io, Vespr, Tokeo, Xerberus, Iagon, and Clarity.

Its core purpose is to **provide sustainable financial backing** and **strategic oversight to high-impact projects** that are directly responsible for existing user adoption, on-chain activity, Total Value Locked (TVL), and ecosystem engagement.
 
While Cardano’s governance structure and funding mechanisms, such as Project Catalyst and core development committees, have been instrumental in bootstrapping protocol advancements and open-source tooling, **there remains a substantial gap in ongoing support for live, user-facing products/services. CB DAO fills that gap.**
 
Through a **transparent governance framework**, **strict accountability mechanisms**, and a **metrics-first funding approach**, CB DAO ensures that builders with growing products on mainnet can scale sustainably, integrate cutting-edge Cardano infrastructure (e.g. Hydra, Leios, Midgard), and contribute to the ecosystem’s long-term growth.","* [Agora](https://github.com/Liqwid-Labs/agora)
* [Clarity](https://www.clarity.vote/)","This proposal is intended to establish a long-term, builder-governed funding mechanism that can continue operating well beyond its initial setup. The ongoing maintenance and support of the Cardano Builder DAO (CB DAO) will be carried out through built-in governance processes and active participation from its verified member projects.
 
Key elements that support long-term sustainability include:
* **Ongoing DAO Governance**: Verified member projects participate directly in governance through voting, discussions, and proposal evaluations. This ensures that decision-making remains active and DAO-led.
* **Elected Board Oversight**: A small group of elected representatives (both members and non-members) help manage compliance, membership approvals, and operational coordination. These roles are re-elected each year to reflect the evolving needs of the community.
* **Structured Funding Cycles**: The DAO operates on a semi-annual schedule for proposal submission, status reporting, and treasury withdrawals. This creates predictable checkpoints for review and accountability.
* **Performance-Based Renewals**: Projects must publicly report KPIs such as, but not limited to, transaction volume, user activity, and development contributions. Continued funding is dependent on demonstrable progress and alignment with previously set goals.
* **Smart Contract-Controlled Treasury**: All treasury operations are governed through Agora, an open-source and audited smart contract library purpose-built for DAO governance. This ensures reliable, transparent, and tamper-proof execution of all funding decisions.
* **Integrated Governance Stack**: CB DAO will leverage Clarity, a governance interface built for the Cardano ecosystem, to streamline the proposal and voting process. Clarity directly interacts with Agora smart contracts, creating a seamless, user-friendly governance experience for members.
* **Return of Unused Funds**: At the end of each funding period, unallocated ADA is returned to the Cardano Treasury as the CB DAO begins to focus on applying for additional funds for a new cycle. This ensures that capital is not locked up unnecessarily and reinforces responsible governance.
* **Legal Support Structure**: CB DAO is working toward establishing a legal entity (such as a Wyoming DUNA) to provide limited liability protections and ensure long-term operational stability. 
 
The overall intent of the CB DAO is to create a durable, well-structured funding mechanism that evolves alongside the Cardano ecosystem, with the flexibility to support its builders and adapt to future needs.

* **Exploring Convertible Grants for Long-Term Ecosystem Value**: The Cardano Builder DAO is committed to exploring innovative funding mechanisms that align incentives and generate long-term value for the Cardano ecosystem. One such model we intend to explore is convertible grants — a hybrid funding instrument that begins as a non-dilutive grant but can convert into equity or tokens under predefined conditions.

With convertible grants, the DAO provides upfront funding to promising builders and projects contributing to the Cardano ecosystem. If the project reaches a significant milestone — such as securing an institutional funding round or achieving mainnet launch — the grant automatically converts into an equity stake or token allocation. This structure allows the DAO to support early-stage innovation while ensuring it shares in the upside of successful ventures.

By adopting this model, the DAO transforms passive grant-making into strategic, ecosystem-aligned investment, helping ensure that long-term value flows back into the Cardano community. It also establishes a precedent for sustainable, incentive-compatible funding — a critical feature for scaling decentralized development across the ecosystem.
","The Cardano Builder DAO (CB DAO) is designed to deliver ongoing ecosystem support for high-impact dApps. The community can expect a series of tangible milestones and ecosystem-wide benefits driven by active participation from DAO members.
 
### Tangible Milestones:
 
1. **Initial Member Onboarding**: KYB and technical review process for the first wave of dApp members Onboarding to governance platform
2. **Board Election**: Election of 3–7 board representatives from the Cardano ecosystem to oversee governance operations
3. **Legal Entity Formation**: Formation of a Wyoming DUNA (or similar DAO-centric legal structure) to support long-term stability and member protections
4. **DAO Launch**: Deployment of CB DAO smart contracts using Agora Creation of DAO owned treasury & initial deposit made
5. **First Funding Cycle Execution**: Launch of the initial proposal window Temperature checks on Clarity and treasury withdrawals for selected projects
6. **First Funding Cycle KPI Impact Reports/Second Round Funding Cycle Execution**: After the first 6 months, projects will submit a KPI report explaining the changes in their KPIs over the first funding cycle. This allows all DReps and Cardano holders to see the impact of the funding provided to these projects. Use the measured impact to determine which projects should continue receiving funding.
7. **Second Funding Cycle KPI Impact Reports**: After the first 6 months, projects will submit a KPI report explaining the changes in their KPIs over the first funding cycle. This allows all DReps and Cardano holders to see the impact of the funding provided to these projects.
 
 
### Ongoing Outcomes for the Ecosystem:
 
* **Sustained Support for Cardano Builders**: CB DAO provides structured, recurring funding to dApps already live on mainnet. This enables them to grow and maintain operations.
* **On-Chain Transparency & Accountability**: Funding decisions and treasury activity are fully governed by smart contracts and tracked through public voting and KPI reporting. This ensures that the impact of resources allocated are measured transparently.
* **Increased Network Usage**: By prioritizing projects that generate transactions, TVL, and user activity, CB DAO directly contributes to the growth and stickiness of the Cardano ecosystem.
* **Community Benefit Through Project Continuity**: The Cardano community benefits from the continued operation of critical products and services, including many they rely on for DeFi, identity, NFTs, tooling, and more. CB DAO creates a path for the community’s favorite products to receive structured support and remain active.
* **Repeatable Funding Mechanism**: CB DAO establishes a replicable framework for funding that could be expanded to other verticals within the Cardano ecosystem. This framework can be scaled and repurposed for different funding subsets.
 
### What the Community Ultimately Receives:
* A sustainable and transparent funding mechanism that supports the growth of Cardano’s application layer
* Operational continuity for trusted, community-used products and services
* An ecosystem where measurable value creation is rewarded and aligned with long-term network health
* A governance system that ensures DAO member projects are accountable and performance-driven, creating higher-quality dApps for end users","Because the Cardano Builder DAO (CB DAO) is built on already available infrastructure, including Agora smart contracts and the Clarity governance interface, no additional protocol or UI development is required to launch. The focus instead shifts to operational execution, governance setup, legal structuring, and project coordination.
 
 
There are currently 12 projects in the Cardano Builder DAO, we expect to be able to support around 20 projects for 12 months with this proposal.
 
 
### Membership Requirements: 
* **Voting Member**: Any individual or company with a Catalyst Proposal Approved. 
* **Requesting Member**: Any company that has successfully closed out a Catalyst Proposal and has a working product with relevant KPIs that improve Cardano.
 
### Estimated Timeline:

Clarity serves as the user-facing interface for interacting with Agora, an open-source, audited library of smart contracts designed for decentralized governance and treasury management.

We have already deployed this infrastructure in production and actively maintain it. Our smart contracts have governed over $10 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) and are used by four DAOs, each managing six-figure treasuries on-chain. These DAOs use the same tooling and processes that CB DAO will leverage, including member-based voting, proposal submission, temperature checks, and treasury execution fully enforced by smart contracts.

In addition to our technical capabilities, we work directly with Cardano ecosystem founders and project teams on a regular basis. Many of these projects are already live on mainnet, and several have expressed intent to participate in CB DAO as members during the initial cohort. This gives us a direct line of communication with the builder community and allows us to ensure early DAO membership includes high-quality, committed teams aligned with CB DAO’s mission and KPIs.

Our team's combination of hands-on DAO implementation, infrastructure development, and builder community engagement positions us uniquely to lead the operational launch and ongoing management of the Cardano Builder DAO.",Other,12000000,0.5,United States Dollar,6000000,"* ADA price Assumption $0.50

Catalyst-funded initiatives often operate under independent branding which rarely mentions ‘Cardano’ which dilutes the visibility of Cardano within the broader blockchain community. This fragmented approach makes it harder for Cardano to stand out amidst the competition.


Competitors like Solana, Aptos, and Sui have established significant brand recognition by strategically aligning global events with developer-focused initiatives. 

Their series of hacker houses and hubs—typically held 3–4 times per year—have
successfully fostered active developer communities and increased Total Value Locked (TVL) on their platforms. These events seamlessly blend ecosystems, attracting talent and partnerships across multiple chains while solidifying their reputation as innovative blockchain leaders.

Without a similarly coordinated and impactful event strategy, Cardano risks being
overshadowed in a competitive landscape. A fresh approach to event planning is

152,OSC Budget Proposal - Paid Open Source Model for Sustainable Development,intersectosc,Core,Group,,,,Open Source Committee (OSC),Intersect Committee,"Pedro Lucas, Adam Dean, Sandip Pandey, Sebastian Pabon, Nicolas Henin, Moritz Angermann, Georg Link, Robin Boening, Johnny Kelly, Christian Taylor, Terence McCutcheon",open-source-committee@intersectmbo.org,"*The Challenge*
Cardano’s open-source ecosystem is critical to the network’s long-term success, yet it lacks structured funding to support its growth. Unlike other blockchain ecosystems that provide clear financial backing for maintainers, contributors, and security efforts, Cardano’s open-source projects often rely on ad-hoc funding or volunteer efforts.

This has led to several challenges:

- Unmaintained Core Infrastructure: Key open-source repositories, including those used by dApp developers and the broader ecosystem, lack dedicated funding for long-term maintenance.
- Loss of Contributors: Without clear incentives, experienced developers leave for other ecosystems, making it harder to sustain projects and onboard new talent.
- Security Risks: A lack of structured funding for bug bounties and incident response leaves Cardano exposed to vulnerabilities that could otherwise be proactively addressed.
- Slower Ecosystem Growth: The absence of stable funding for new tools, developer education, and strategic project support makes it difficult to keep pace with industry advancements.

*Why This Matters*

If Cardano wants to remain a competitive, developer-friendly blockchain, it must invest in the sustainability of its open-source infrastructure. Without structured funding, key projects will stagnate, developer engagement will decline, and security risks will increase.

A well-supported open-source ecosystem ensures:
- Reliable infrastructure for wallets, dApps, and developer tooling.
- More engaged developers who have clear pathways to contribute and earn.
- Stronger security with funding for bug bounties and incident response.
- A faster-growing ecosystem where teams can build with confidence, knowing key tools and services are actively maintained.","*Governance Model*

This budget proposal asks that the Open Source Committee (OSC) be granted delegated authority by DReps to manage the ₳5,885,000 allocation. 
This means the OSC will be responsible for:
- Selecting and funding open-source projects that align with Cardano’s ecosystem needs.
- Managing contracts with maintainers, vendors, and contributors.
- Allocating funds efficiently across key initiatives, including maintenance, security, and developer growth.
- Overseeing security programs such as bug bounties and incident monitoring.
- Ensuring community engagement by keeping funding decisions transparent and performance-driven.

By giving the OSC direct oversight, this approach avoids bottlenecks while keeping decision-making close to those who understand open-source development.

*Scope of Work*

The proposal covers a range of open-source funding needs that are critical to Cardano’s long-term success, including:
- Maintainer Retainer Program – Funding 50+ open-source projects, split between Core Cardano and community-selected initiatives.
- Security & Incident Response – Running a bug bounty program and 24/7 security monitoring to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- Developer Growth & Engagement – Supporting developer advocates, mentorship programs, and bounties to expand the contributor pipeline.
- Ecosystem Expansion – Backing early-stage open-source projects through incubation and accelerator programs to drive adoption.
- Operational & Community Support – Funding project support services, infrastructure improvements, and legal or educational initiatives as needed.","*The Solution: The Paid Open Source Model*

This budget proposal introduces a Paid Open Source Model to ensure that essential open-source projects receive structured funding. It includes:
- A Maintainer Retainer Program to fund developers maintaining critical repositories.
- Bug bounty and security initiatives to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
- Developer advocacy and engagement programs to onboard and retain contributors.
- An incubation framework to support promising open-source projects and help them scale.

By implementing this model, Cardano will create a predictable, transparent, and sustainable funding mechanism that supports long-term open-source development, improves security, and accelerates ecosystem growth.",It supports the product roadmap,Open Source Committee,"Cardano Forum post: Cardano Core Budget Proposal - Governance / Budgets 2025 - Cardano Forum: https://forum.cardano.org/t/cardano-core-budget-proposal/143047

600,Expanding Stablecoin / Cardano Native Asset Support / Fiat Ramps,anzens,Marketing & Innovation,Company,Anzens Inc.,www.anzens.com,United States,,,,shantnoo@anzens.com / TG @shantnoo6,"1. Lack of Wallet & Custodian Support for Cardano Native Assets:
Major institutional custodians (e.g BitGo, Fireblocks) do not natively support Cardano native assets, including USDA. This creates a bottleneck for exchanges, OTC desks and institutions who rely on these custodians for secure asset storage. Without custodian integration:
-Exchanges cannot list Cardano-native assets, limiting liquidity and trading opportunities
-Institutional investors face custody risks, reducing their willingness to engage with Cardano Ecosystem
-Cardano projects struggle to attract capital, as investors prefer assets with established custody solutions

Impact:The absence of institutional-grade custody solutions stifles liquidity, restricts market access and slows Cardano’s growth.

2. Limited Availability of Cardano Native Assets on Exchanges & OTC Desks:
Despite Cardano’s $700M+ DeFi ecosystem, its native assets—including stablecoins—are severely underrepresented on centralized exchanges (CEXs) and OTC desks.
-Few trading pairs for Cardano assets (eg. ADA/USDA, USDA/USDT)
-No derivatives markets (futures, options) for Cardano stablecoins, limiting trading volumes
-OTC desks avoid Cardano-native assets due to limited institutional LPs
Impact: Without deep exchange liquidity, traders and institutions cannot efficiently enter or exit positions

3. Lack of Real-World Stablecoin Utility Beyond Crypto Trading:
Stablecoins mainly serve crypto trading, with USDC gaining enterprise use—while Cardano’s stablecoins remain underutilized across real-world sectors:
-Cross-border B2B payments ($31.6 trillion market)
-Remittances ($850 billion market and where low fees matter)
-Payroll & merchant settlements
Cardano’s low fee structure makes it ideal for payments, but the lack of integration with traditional finance, prevents adoption.

Impact: Without real-world use cases, Cardano’s stablecoins are limited to DeFi

4. Restricted Fiat On/Off-Ramp, Especially in Frontier Markets:
Users in emerging markets (Africa, LATAM, Asia) struggle to convert ADA and Cardano-native assets into local fiat due to:
-High fees (5-7% for card-based ramps vs. ~1% for local bank transfers
-Limited payout network & banking access
Impact: Limited DeFi participation and slow retail adoption due to costly on/off ramps.
Ethereum & Ripple are expanding stablecoin adoption. Without custody solutions, Cardano misses institutional demand. Stablecoins will reshape global finance, and frontier markets need blockchain.",,"a. Wallet Support for Cardano Native Assets: USDA is pursuing strategic partnerships with firms like Zoida Markets, and in talks with BitGo, Zodia Custody, CipherBC, etc. Our goal is to enhance Cardano Native Assets by improving reach, reliability, and pricing through collaboration with key custodians, and wallet infrastructure providers—ultimately boosting distribution, liquidity and user adoption.
b. Availability of USDA / Native Assets on Exchanges, OTC Desks and NEO Banks: Anzens is focused on bringing USDA to CEXs, NEO banks, OTC desks, and other key distributors to expand its reach. By enabling USDA pairs for Cardano tokens on exchanges, we aim to boost usability, drive adoption through spot listings, and support broader participation via derivatives trading. Enabling USDA with NEO banks would offer USDA <> Fiat pairs in exotic currencies

c. Drive USDA adoption to unlock real-world utility: Anzens would be initiating cross integration with real estate developers, remittance companies and other payment companies to bring USDA as part of their backend settlement network, helping Cardano gain adoption beyond the crypto space.

d. Access to Fiat on and off-ramps:  Encryptus has piloted ADA-to-fiat off-ramps for Yoroi Wallet users, enabling users to convert ADA to local currencies across 70+ countries—including India, China, Philippines, Nigeria etc—via bank transfers, without relying on SWIFT or card networks. Encryptus aims to build stronger on-ramps with local payment rails.

The funds from this proposal would be utilized to:
1. Develop Onramp Capabilities: Current ADA onramps via cards are costly and don’t support Cardano Native Assets. Encryptus aims to solve this by offering low-cost onramps through local bank transfers and mobile wallets—cutting costs by up to 60%. This will ease access to ADA and native assets.  Ideal for Cardano DeFi and wider eco-system. Phase 1 of the services would include countries in LATAM, Africa and parts of Asia with a Phase 2 expansion to developed economies. 
2. Cardano’s deterministic fee structure makes it well-suited for payment use cases. However, integration with traditional payment systems has been a challenge. Encryptus is addressing this by developing alternative payment solutions—such as global bill payments, school fees, and Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) products—on the Cardano blockchain. These initiatives showcase Cardano’s practical value to Web2 users, helping to broaden its adoption and real-world relevance.

","The Cardano blockchain has emerged as a leading smart contract platform, offering scalability, security, and sustainability. However, despite its technological advantages, Cardano faces critical challenges in mainstream adoption, particularly in the areas of stablecoin liquidity, wallet support for native assets, exchange availability, and fiat on/off-ramps. These limitations hinder Cardano’s ability to compete with other major blockchains in real-world financial applications.
This proposal seeks funding to address these challenges by:
1. Expanding wallet and custodian support for Cardano native assets (including USDA, a Cardano-native stablecoin).
2. Increasing the availability of Cardano stablecoins and native assets on exchanges and OTC desks.
3. Driving real-world utility for USDA in cross-border payments, remittances, and enterprise settlements.
4. Building cost-effective fiat on/off-ramps for ADA and Cardano native assets in frontier markets.
By addressing these challenges, we aim to boost liquidity, accessibility, and adoption of Cardano’s DeFi and real-world use cases, bridging traditional finance with our open source blockchain-based payments 

Problem Statements & Proposed Solutions
1. Custody & Wallet Gaps: Cardano native assets lack support from institutional custodians like BitGo and Fireblocks, limiting exchange listings and adoption.
Solution: Partner with custodians to integrate USDA and other assets, enable institutional-grade custody, and expand wallet compatibility.
Impact: Boosted liquidity, institutional access, and DeFi growth.

2. Exchange & OTC Access: Cardano assets remain underrepresented on CEXs and OTC desks, restricting liquidity and accessibility.
Solution: Secure Exchange USDA listings (spot and derivatives), form OTC partnerships, and integrate with Neo Banks.
Impact: Better price discovery, increased trading pairs, enhanced fiat liquidity, and wider market participation.

3. Real-World Utility: Stablecoin use is mostly limited to crypto trading, despite Cardano’s efficient fee model.
Solution: Enable B2B payments, remittances, payroll, and bill payments using USDA.
Impact: Broader adoption beyond DeFi and stronger traditional finance integration.

4. Fiat On/Off-Ramps: Users face high-cost (Fiat to ADA), limited access to convert ADA/native assets into fiat.
Solution: Deploy low-cost onramps via bank transfers/mobile wallets; expand offramps (piloted via Yoroi).
Impact: Reduced friction, deeper liquidity, and increased financial inclusion.",Our one key dependency is securing the capital to build out our on-ramps and secure additional regulatory approvals.,"Encryptus and Anzens remain committed to investing capital and resources to support the growth of USDA and the development of robust on/off-ramp infrastructure for the Cardano ecosystem. As each phase of deployment progresses, the Cardano community will be encouraged to engage with the services and provide feedback, enabling continuous improvement and greater user adoption","A.

638,Ecosystem Exchange Listing and Market Making service pool,flowdesk_governance,Marketing & Innovation,Company,Flowdesk,https://www.flowdesk.co/,France,,,,https://x.com/flowdesk_co,"Proposal Overview

This proposal aims to address two core issues within the Cardano ecosystem:

- Problem 1: No Cardano project currently has a top-tier market maker, with the exception of Snek and Iagon.
- Problem 2: No Cardano Native Token (CNT) is listed on top-tier exchanges such as Binance, Bybit, Okex, Kraken and Coinbase.

Objective

We, at Flowdesk, are committed to solving these problems. Our goal is to act as a trustworthy partner in assisting Cardano Web 3.0 projects by providing essential services such as Market Making as-a-Service (MMAAS) and helping with exchange listings. Through these efforts, we aim to enhance the overall liquidity and market presence of Cardano projects.

",,"Beneficiaries would be the:

- Issuer of CNTs, Cardano Web 3.0 projects helping with the growth of their token (from TGE to DEX liquidity seeding to CEX listings)
- Retail Cardano traders and investors benefiting from institution-grade liquidity when transacting on DEX and CEX

Example of success:
- Snek market making started on November 10th with SNEK/USDT price at 0.0017. Flowdesk managed to successfully provide liquidity in ultra-volatile conditions with the token surging by more than 5x and ensuring that CEX liquidity is at minimum $20k within +/- 2% and ensuring that DeFi protocols pools are arbitrage-free.

1- Exchange Listing Fee Pool: 

Eligible exchanges are Kraken, Bybit, Okex and Binance (only top tier exchanges that are requiring new technical integration of CNT)

Budget: Up to 1,500,000 USD (3m ADA at a reference price of 0.5 USD / ADA).

Notes:
- Top-tier exchanges might ask a listing fee > 500,000 USD. An indicative quote from one top-tier exchange would be around 1m USD of token allocation.
- Not more than 500k USD (1m ADA) will be allocated for 1 CNT / Exchange.
- Flowdesk acts as an actor of good faith to validate the budget allocated to a Cardano project for a listing.
- Flowdesk does NOT receive any funds from the Intersect budget during this process (including no transaction fee, commission fee, etc.).
- Flow for a Cardano project to request funds to get listed on an exchange:

=> 1 Cardano project with a CNT

=> Project agrees with the exchange on a listing offer

=> Flowdesk Exchange Listing Criteria Assessment

=> Decision

=> If successful, exchange directly receives funding from Intersect for listing the CNT

=> CNT is listed on the exchange.






2- Market Making Fee Pool: 

Eligible tokens are:

-Non stable coins: SNEK, IAG, MIN and HOSKY

-Stable coins: USDM, USDA, iUSD, DJED, KINKA (gold backed)


Budget: 63,000 USD (126,000 ADA at a reference price of 0.5 USD / ADA).


Notes:

- Intersect > Cardano Project > pays Flowdesk monthly retainer for MMAAS business.
- Flowdesk does NOT receive any funds from the Intersect budget during this process (including no transaction fee, commission, etc.).

- Flow for a Cardano project to request funds for MMAAS with Flowdesk:

=> Cardano projects
=> Project agrees with Flowdesk on a MMAAS offering

=> Cardano project receives funding from Intersect

=> Flowdesk launches the MMAAS service.
","Dependency 1 - Organic Demand on CNTs (MMAAS):

For market-making purposes, at least one of the following three conditions must be satisfied for a token to benefit from liquidity provision via Flowdesk MMAAS:

- Condition 1: A minimum of $50k/day organic trading volume on each CEX.
- Condition 2: The token is a stablecoin with a price peg to a target level (e.g., $1).
- Condition 3: 
If the token is not yet listed on a CEX:  
1. Minimum trading volume of 100k ADA/day for the past 2 months.
2. On-chain liquidity of at least 7m ADA.
3. Additionally, there must be an agreement with a CEX for the listing. Since Flowdesk requires sourcing liquidity from the DEX to provide MMAAS, sufficient on-chain liquidity is necessary to enable CEX/DEX MMAAS services.

Objective:

Help CNT tokens achieving top tier exchanges listings and experiencing deep liquidity.
- For Cardano to grow and attract external liquidity, stablecoin tokens must first be listed on leading centralized exchanges (CEXs).
- Top Cardano projects already listed should expand to major exchanges to enhance liquidity.
- Smaller projects should have fair opportunities for liquidity and support for tokens not yet listed on CEXs.

Dependency 2 - Centralized Exchanges (Listings):

- CEXs act as the ultimate gatekeepers of token listings. While Flowdesk can assist in the listing process, its mandate does not include lobbying exchanges for listings.

- Flowdesk’s role in the listing process is to ensure that the budget is allocated fairly, based on the following criteria:

Top-tier Exchange Integration:
- Opportunities for top-tier exchanges to integrate Cardano CNT tokens (e.g., targeting Binance, Bybit, OKX, and/or Coinbase, which do not yet support CNTs).
- Cardano Foundation will assist with native asset support if the exchange requires technical integration.

Impact Assessment:
- Evaluate the potential effect of the exchange listing.
- Ensure it significantly increases CNT liquidity, based on historical data.
",No technical maintenance.,"MMAAS: 

- 3 CNT’s experiencing deeper liquidity on CEX (minimum 5k$ +/- 2%) and arbitrage free swaps on DEX
- Sign 3 Cardano projects with a template of 7k$/month retainer for MM service

","Haus is building an open-source Tokenized Home Equity Liquidity Protocol to unlock the $16 trillion in illiquid home equity sitting in U.S. residential real estate. By leveraging blockchain technology, our platform enables homeowners to sell fractional ownership of their home equity, instantly accessing liquidity while allowing investors to gain exposure to real estate appreciation.

We have already prototyped and deployed this model on a private Ethereum blockchain, securing $20 million in Total Value Locked (TVL). With this proposal, we aim to transition HausCoin and the liquidity protocol to Cardano, leveraging its secure, scalable, and cost-effective infrastructure to power a decentralized marketplace for home equity trading.

## Proposal Scope & Objectives

### Tokenizing Home Equity on Cardano:
- Haus will move its existing liquidity protocol onto Cardano’s mainnet, allowing homeowners to tokenize and sell portions of their home equity directly to investors.  
- This will create an efficient and scalable real estate-backed asset class, providing homeowners with cash liquidity and investors with a share in home appreciation.

### Launching HausCoin on Cardano:
- Haus will issue HausCoin, a real estate-backed token enabling home equity trading at scale.  
- Investors will be able to buy, sell, and trade tokenized real estate assets, unlocking new DeFi use cases for real-world assets (RWAs).

### Leveraging an Existing 30,000-User Waitlist ($4.1B in TVL):
- Haus already has a 30,000-person waitlist representing $4.1 billion in Total Home Equity Value (TVL).  
- A fraction of this TVL will be onboarded to Cardano, driving real-world adoption of the protocol.

### Building a Legal Framework for Compliance:
- Haus will develop a regulatory-compliant framework for issuing and trading tokenized real estate in the U.S., EU and international markets.  
- Legal and financial structuring will ensure seamless integration with traditional real estate markets.

### Deploying Liquidity Pools & Market Infrastructure:
- Haus will establish liquidity pools to facilitate instant trading and lending of home equity tokens.  
- This will support DeFi integration, enabling real estate-backed lending, yield farming, and staking mechanisms.

### Product Completion & Market Expansion:
- Funding will be used to finalize product development, enhance the user experience, and integrate with key blockchain ecosystems.  
- Haus will drive market adoption through strategic partnerships, marketing, and investor outreach.

## Why Cardano?

Cardano’s blockchain infrastructure offers a secure, scalable, and cost-effective environment for tokenized assets. By migrating our home equity liquidity protocol and HausCoin to Cardano, we unlock:

- Low-cost transactions for seamless trading and fractional ownership.  
- Smart contract security for compliant real estate tokenization.  
- DeFi compatibility, enabling home equity-backed lending and staking.

## Impact & Vision

Haus is pioneering the future of real estate tokenization, transforming home equity into a liquid, tradeable asset class. By launching on Cardano, we aim to bring institutional-grade real estate investing to blockchain, opening new opportunities for homeowners, investors, and the broader DeFi ecosystem.
","Haus has already developed 80–85% of the open-source protocol and has conducted proof of operations and product-market fit validation over the last few years on a private Ethereum blockchain. With 36 home transactions completed and $20M in TVL, our core infrastructure is largely built, reducing overall dependencies.

However, a few key dependencies remain for fully completing the Haus Tokenized Liquidity Protocol on Cardano:

- **DeFi Exchange Partnerships** – While we’ve had promising initial conversations with platforms like MinSwap, we may need to secure additional DeFi partners for liquidity provisioning and token trading.

- **Cardano Developer Talent** – We require skilled Cardano blockchain developers to port our existing code from the private blockchain to the Cardano ecosystem.

- **Funding & Grants** – To finalize deployment and legal structuring, we must secure funding through grant proposals or alternative investment sources.

Given our strong foundation and proven market validation, the remaining dependencies are minimal compared to most early-stage blockchain projects.
","Haus is already an operational company with $25M+ AUM, $20M in TVL, and $150K in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) from fractional real estate-backed transactions. With a validated business model and strong market demand, we anticipate breaking even quickly and operating profitably, ensuring long-term sustainability without reliance on continuous external funding.

The proposed transition to Cardano will further expand participation and liquidity in the ecosystem. Our long-term maintenance and support strategy include:

### Ongoing Development & Upgrades
- Haus has a dedicated engineering team responsible for maintaining, optimizing, and upgrading the protocol.  
- Regular smart contract audits and compliance updates will ensure security, efficiency, and regulatory adherence.  
- Future improvements will include enhanced liquidity mechanisms, AI-driven valuation models, and broader DeFi integrations.

### Liquidity & Ecosystem Growth
- This proposal will attract more participants to the ecosystem, increasing liquidity and adoption of HausCoin.  
- We will establish long-term partnerships with DeFi exchanges (e.g., MinSwap) and liquidity providers to support real estate-backed token trading.  
- Launching liquidity pools and staking mechanisms will incentivize continuous user engagement.

### Sustainable Funding & Revenue Model
- Haus already has $150K ARR from revenue-generating customers, demonstrating early traction and financial viability.  
- The protocol will continue to generate income through transaction fees, staking rewards, and tokenized real estate services.  
- With its proven monetization model, Haus expects to achieve profitability quickly, enabling self-sustained operations without long-term dependence on grants.  
- Additional funding will be secured through strategic partnerships, institutional adoption, and ecosystem incentives.

### User Adoption & Support
- Haus will provide comprehensive documentation, developer tools, and onboarding support for homeowners, investors, and developers.  
- A dedicated customer support team will ensure seamless platform usage and engagement.  
- Educational initiatives and targeted marketing campaigns will drive further adoption and awareness of real estate tokenization.

With a proven track record of managing tokenized real estate assets, existing ARR, and a growing user base, Haus is well-positioned to scale on Cardano, achieve profitability, and sustain operations independently, ensuring the long-term success of the Tokenized Liquidity Protocol.

This initiative will digitize billions in illiquid real estate, enabling global investment access, increasing Cardano adoption, and establishing real estate as a DeFi-native asset class.

We see a massive opportunity to revolutionize real-world asset (RWA) tokenization by implementing the Haus Liquidity Tokenization Protocol on Cardano.

The global real estate market is valued at $250T, with $40T in U.S. residential real estate and $17T in untapped home equity. Each year $3T in single-family homes change hands—of which $500B is investment real estate.

By launching Haus on Cardano, we will:

- Unlock billions in idle home equity, making it investable.  
- Bring real estate tokenization to Cardano, increasing liquidity and adoption.  
- Enable global investors to access U.S. dollar-denominated, real estate-backed assets.  
- Facilitate cross-border investments, opening new financial opportunities.  
- Provide investors with high ROI potential (historically up to 25%).  
- Establish home equity-backed tokens as a new asset class.  
- Digitize billions in illiquid real estate, benefiting the broader economy.  
- Create low-cost securitization solutions, reducing financial inefficiencies.  
- Enable new financial products, such as home equity-backed credit cards with low interest rates, HELOCS, Mortgages and Auto Loans.

This initiative will drive mainstream adoption of Cardano as the premier platform for tokenized home equity and real estate investments.

partnerchains as our native evolution of sidechains, Midgard aims to be our native
evolution of rollups.

The UTxO system is a match made in heaven for rollups. It allows us to build true L2
rollups that inherit maximal security from Cardano. This cannot be replicated in account
based systems. It’s not a coincidence that Fuel, the first general purpose L2 to receive a
decentralization rating of stage 2 (highest possible) is UTxO based.

Fraud proofs for global state systems like Arbitrum and Optimism are extremely
difficult to implement and very expensive and complicated to conduct onchain (and
require multiple parties);this is why to this date despite spending millions in R&D neither
of those protocols has working fraud proofs, and they all rely on centralized
permissioned sequencers and operators.

On the other-hand, fraud proofs on Cardano are extremely straightforward and
require only a single party (no challenge-response proofs) due to the local state
properties of the ledger.

Not a single blockchain has managed to achieve true permissionless general purpose
rollups. At the end of the day, the top “L2s”in the blockchain space right now are all
custodial multisigs. The Midgard framework is a first of its kind, in its capabilities to
deploy completely permissionless rollups that inherit the full security of Cardano.
No centralized sequencer
No challenge response “proofs”
No custodial multisig
Permissionless fraud proofs (open to anyone)
Permissionless operator set
Deposits and withdrawals cannot be censored (inherits the full censorship
resistance of Cardano)

This is all made possible by Cardano’s unique local state EUTxO architecture.

UTxO contention, small block size, local state, transaction determinism, all of these
“problems” may have led you to question why these design choices were made.

Midgard aims to show you that these are actually not problems at all. In-fact quite the
opposite, they are extremely powerful properties that, together, provide unique value
that simply does not exist in any other ecosystem. These are, in actuality, the core pillars
that make Midgard even possible in the first place.

You cannot build Midgard on Ethereum, Solana or Sui. It is a protocol that is only possible
on Cardano.",,"Midgard has a tokenless design. All transaction fees on Midgard are paid in Ada, and every Midgard block is published to the Cardano L1. Where Hydra moves transactions offchain (and thus does not contribute consistently in fee revenue to the Cardano L1) Midgard keeps transactions onchain but in a more compact form (ie. rolls up transactions offchain into a compact representation that is published onchain, thus the name rollups). This means that increased economic activity on Midgard directly translated to increased economic activity on Cardano, this represents a significant source of fee revenue for the Cardano L1. Midgard does not have independent consensus or economic security, instead it inherits economic security and consensus from Cardano.",L2 Expansion,Technical Steering Committee,Midgard likely has the single highest community endorsement out of any proposed roadmap item.,"Midgard is a modular framework for deploying optimistic rollup Layer 2s on the Cardano blockchain, designed to enhance transaction throughput, reduce costs, and enable advanced decentralized applications.","There are no strict dependencies, Midgard is on schedule to deliver by end-of-year.

645,Complement Catalyst: Extended Quadratic Funding—Zero Operational Costs,socious_fund,Marketing & Innovation,Company,Socious Global Inc.,https://socious.io,British Virgin Islands,,,,x.com/SociousDAO,"## Executive Summary

We propose an innovative funding mechanism to complement Project Catalyst by addressing five critical challenges in blockchain ecosystem innovation funding: concentrated voter power, treasury fund limitations, inadequate impact reporting, uncertain ROI, and inefficient milestone management. Our solution has zero operational costs—100% of funds go directly to Cardano projects. By combining quadratic funding with a reputation-based system, we create a more democratic, transparent, and effective allocation process while maximizing treasury fund impact. 

## Problem Statement: Why We Need a new Funding Mechanism

Funding innovation within blockchain ecosystems presents significant challenges, yet some initiatives shine brightly. Project Catalyst stands out as a prime example, having fueled over 2,100 projects with more than $150 million, a clear testament to Cardano’s dedication to decentralized innovation. Still, persistent hurdles across all ecosystems underscore the need for continued refinement in funding approaches.

### 1. Concentrated Voting Power

**Current Problem:** Concentrated voting power is a widespread issue across blockchain ecosystems. In Project Catalyst, recent research by Nelson et al. (2024) shows that just 1.5% of wallets can determine funding outcomes in 97.5% of voting scenarios. Fund 13 starkly demonstrated this when a single entity effectively controlled most allocation decisions. To address this issue, Project Catalyst plans to implement a generalized quadratic voting mechanism in Fund 14.

**Impact:** When funding decisions reflect the interests of a few large stakeholders rather than the broader community, we risk:

- Creating an innovation monoculture
- Discouraging grassroots participation
- Undermining the ecosystem's decentralization principles

### 2. Limited Treasury Resources

**Current Problem:** Blockchain ecosystem treasury, including Cardano’s, cannot indefinitely sustain the growing demand for funding as the ecosystem expands.

**Impact:** Without supplementary funding sources, fewer worthy projects receive support, slowing ecosystem growth and adoption.

### 3. Challenges in reporting impact

**Current Problem:** Measuring funded projects' contributions to ecosystem growth remains a significant challenge across all blockchain ecosystems.

**Impact:** The lack of rigorous impact assessment makes it impossible to optimize funding allocation or demonstrate value to stakeholders.

### 4. Uncertain Return on Investment

**Current Problem:** The treasury currently functions as a one-way funding stream without mechanisms to capture value generated by successful projects.

**Impact:** The ecosystem misses opportunities to create a sustainable funding cycle where successful projects contribute to future innovation.

### 5. Challenges in Milestone Management

**Current Problem:** For all ecosystems, it's challenging to balance rigorous milestone management with swift decision-making. There's also uncertainty around who should review milestones and resolve disputes. 

**Impact:** Emphasizing rigorous milestone management can lead to bureaucracy and delayed achievements, while prioritizing speed may compromise ecosystem impact.

## Our Solution: Extended Quadratic Funding

We propose a complementary funding mechanism that addresses these challenges through a combination of innovative approaches:

### 1. Democratizing Decision-Making

Our extended quadratic funding model calculates voting power using two factors:

1. **Square root of donation amount** (e.g., $9 donation = 3 votes)
2. **Logarithmic reputation score** (Impact Score) ranging from 300-850

This approach balances financial contribution with proven community impact, preventing wealth concentration from dominating decisions while maintaining skin-in-the-game principles.

To protect this system's integrity, we implement:

- **Sybil resistance:** Zero-knowledge proof KYC via Hyperledger Identus (formerly Atala PRISM) ensures one-human-one-account without compromising privacy
- **Anti-collusion measures:**
    - Reputation incentives that make system integrity valuable to high-impact participants
    - Penalties including reputation loss or platform bans for collusion attempts
    - Economic disincentives through fee structures that make vote-splitting unprofitable
    - Use [Connection-Oriented Cluster Matching](https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/leveling-the-field-how-connection-oriented-cluster-matching-strengthens-quadratic-funding)

For more information on formal proofs of quadratic voting and literature reviews, see [Kovalchuk et al. 2024](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hq_P_BEvXDhJcph6zmA0_CQHTcO0lyAZ/view?usp=sharing), [Ostrom 2010](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ej30QuyfcyCjNABd6O6S3MEk5Dy14WyL/view?usp=sharing), [Lalley and Weyl 2015](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EjZoN4Gcxjwb0Va0OuRgEgBYRVcgDiWI/view?usp=drive_link), and [Poster and Weyl 2019](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E_tXBhMIO6WLeVVpv3J_AsicTiSKAUze/view?usp=drive_link).   

### 2. Multiplying Treasury Impact

Our model transforms the treasury from sole funder to catalyst:

- Individual donors contribute alongside treasury funds, potentially increasing available capital by 50%+
- U.S. donors benefit from 501(c)(3) tax deductions, creating unique incentives outside the crypto ecosystem
- Donations increase projects' chances of receiving matching funds, aligning individual and ecosystem interests

**Example:** A $1M treasury allocation could attract $500K in individual donations, yielding $1.5M total funding while building broader community investment. Please see more details in the “Why this amount” section below. 

### 3. Standardized Impact Reporting

All funded projects must:

- Contract with designated impact accountants (funded from project allocation)
- Report standardized metrics including:
    - On-chain transactions generated
    - New wallets created
    - Active users acquired
    - Other ecosystem growth indicators

This creates the first comprehensive dataset of innovation ROI within the Cardano ecosystem.

### 4. Sustainable Value Capture

We establish a voluntary contribution system where funded projects share value with the ecosystem through:

- Equity stakes
- Token allocations
- Revenue sharing agreements
- Carbon credits or other generated assets

Our target is a 5% annual return within 10 years—an ambitious but achievable goal based on startup ecosystem standards.

The most reliable measure of VC fund returns comes from the Cambridge Associates US Venture Capital Index, which shows an 8.5% annual return over 10 years as of December 31, 2023. While this net return to limited partners reflects the overall pooled performance, typical median returns are lower, around 4-5%, due to the skewed distribution of returns.

### 5. Efficient Milestone Management

Our streamlined process features:

- Token incentives for prompt reviewer decisions
- Financial penalties for reviewers whose decisions are overturned
- Decentralized dispute resolution mechanism (detailed at: https://socious.gitbook.io/whitepaper/decentralized-dispute-resolution)

This creates a self-balancing system encouraging both speed and accuracy. 

This is particularly beneficial for teams seeking small amounts of funding, who often struggle with Catalyst's lengthy milestone approval process. 

## Conclusion

The Extended Quadratic Funding model doesn't replace Project Catalyst but complements it, bringing additional funding, greater participation, and enhanced accountability to Cardano's innovation ecosystem. 

We want to emphasize Project Catalyst's remarkable achievements. The Catalyst team carefully listens to community feedback and improves with each round. For example, they removed the downvote feature in response to community input. In Fund 14, Catalyst plans to implement a generalized quadratic voting system. The impact Catalyst has had on the Cardano community cannot be overstated. The challenges mentioned above are common across the industry rather than specific to Catalyst. As noted earlier, the Extended Quadratic Funding model is designed to complement—not replace—Project Catalyst. 

By addressing the aforementioned challenges, we can accelerate Cardano's development while embodying its core principles of decentralization, sustainability, and community governance.

The Cardano ecosystem stands at a crucial point in its evolution. Having allocated over $150 million through Project Catalyst to fund 2,161 projects, we have witnessed both the remarkable potential and inherent challenges of our current funding mechanisms—challenges common across all blockchain ecosystems. 

As Cardano matures, so too must our approach to fostering innovation and allocating resources within the ecosystem.

This proposal introduces Extended Quadratic Funding (EQF) as a complementary funding mechanism to Project Catalyst—designed not to replace but to enhance Cardano's innovation landscape by addressing five critical limitations in the current system: centralized voting power, limited treasury resources, inadequate impact reporting, unclear return on investment, and inefficient milestone management.

Extended Quadratic Funding combines the mathematical elegance of quadratic voting with reputation-based mechanisms and decentralized governance to create a more equitable, efficient, and sustainable funding ecosystem. Our approach draws inspiration from successful quadratic funding implementations in other blockchain ecosystems while incorporating unique elements tailored to Cardano's specific needs and values.

### The Current Landscape: Achievements and Limitations of Project Catalyst

Project Catalyst represents one of the largest decentralized innovation funds in the blockchain space, demonstrating Cardano's commitment to community-driven development. Through multiple funding rounds, it has supported a diverse array of projects spanning DeFi protocols, educational initiatives, infrastructure improvements, and real-world applications.

However, as the ecosystem has grown, several structural limitations have become increasingly apparent which are common in all blockchain ecosystems:

### 1. Centralized Voting Power

Recent research by Nelson et al. (2024) has quantified what many community members have observed anecdotally: voting power in Project Catalyst is highly concentrated. Their analysis revealed that in 97.5% of voting coalition scenarios, just 1.5% of wallets could determine the final outcome. This concentration reached its apex in Fund 13, where a single entity effectively controlled most funding decisions.

This concentration creates several problems:

- **Narrowed Innovation Focus**: When funding decisions reflect the interests of a few large stakeholders, we risk prioritizing certain types of projects while neglecting others that might better serve the broader ecosystem.
- **Diminished Participation Incentives**: Small token holders have little motivation to participate in governance when their votes rarely influence outcomes.
- **Vulnerability to Capture**: Concentrated decision-making power creates potential vulnerabilities to special interests that may not align with the ecosystem's long-term health.
- **Inconsistency with Cardano's Philosophy**: The current voting mechanism contradicts Cardano's foundational commitment to decentralization and broad-based governance.

### 2. Limited Treasury Resources

Every blockchain ecosystem has a finite treasury. As ecosystems grow and funding demands increase, treasuries face mounting pressure. The current model's exclusive reliance on treasury funds—without additional capital sources—limits both the number and scope of projects that can receive support.

Furthermore, the all-or-nothing approach to project funding creates inefficiencies: projects either receive their requested amount or nothing at all, lacking mechanisms for partial funding based on broader community support.

### 3. Inadequate Impact Reporting

Like all innovation funding systems, Project Catalyst faces challenges in establishing standardized mechanisms to track and report the impact of funded projects. 

This creates several challenges:

- **Difficulty Measuring ROI**: Without consistent metrics, it's nearly impossible to evaluate the return on investment for ecosystem funds.
- **Limited Learning Opportunities**: The absence of standardized impact data prevents the community from identifying successful funding patterns that could inform future allocations.
- **Reduced Accountability**: Without transparent reporting requirements, funded teams have limited incentives to maximize their projects' ecosystem impact.
- **Undermined Community Trust**: The lack of clear impact evidence can erode stakeholder confidence in the funding process over time.

### 4. Unclear Return on Investment

The current funding model operates as a one-way flow of resources: treasury funds are allocated to projects without mechanisms for value to flow back to the ecosystem. While this grant-based approach is appropriate for many public goods, it fails to capture potential value from successful commercial projects that achieve significant traction or profitability.

This limitation:

- Reduces the treasury's long-term sustainability
- Fails to maximize the ecosystem's return on successful projects
- Creates a potential misalignment of incentives between funded teams and the broader community

### 5. Inefficient Milestone Management

Milestone review processes across the industry, including Project Catalyst have become a significant challenge, with funded teams often waiting months for payments during review periods. These centralized, opaque processes create:

- **Cash Flow Challenges**: Extended payment delays force teams to self-fund development, advantaging well-capitalized teams over bootstrapped innovators.
- **Project Abandonment**: Payment delays have contributed to numerous teams abandoning funded projects, wasting both treasury resources and development efforts.
- **Dispute Resolution Inefficiencies**: The current system requires the Catalyst team to mediate all disputes between reviewers and funded proposers, creating a significant administrative burden.
- **Scaling Limitations**: As the number of funded projects grows, the centralized review process becomes increasingly untenable.

### Extended Quadratic Funding: A New Paradigm

Extended Quadratic Funding addresses these limitations through five interconnected innovations:

### 1. Democratizing Decision-Making

At the core of our proposal is a novel voting mechanism that balances financial contribution with demonstrated community impact. The EQF voting power calculation multiplies:

1. **The square root of the donation amount in USD**
    - Example: A $9 donation yields 3 votes (√9 = 3)
    - Example: A $100 donation yields 10 votes (√100 = 10)
    - Example: A $10,000 donation yields 100 votes (√10,000 = 100)
2. **Impact Score—a logarithmic representation of reputation**
    - Ranges from 300 to 850 (similar to credit score systems)
    - Increases more slowly as score rises (logarithmic scaling)

This dual mechanism ensures that while financial contribution remains important, its influence is both:

- **Mathematically constrained** through the square root function (quadratic scaling)
- **Balanced by reputation** through the Impact Score multiplier

For example:

- A new community member donating $100 with a baseline Impact Score of 300 would have 10 × 300 = 3,000 voting power
- An established contributor donating $100 with an Impact Score of 700 would have 10 × 700 = 7,000 voting power
- A whale donating $10,000 with a baseline Impact Score would have 100 × 300 = 30,000 voting power

This system significantly reduces the plutocratic effect of the current one-coin-one-vote system while maintaining ""skin in the game"" principles through financial contribution requirements.

### Sybil Resistance

To protect the integrity of this system, we implement robust Sybil resistance through Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) verification powered by Hyperledger Identus (formerly Atala PRISM). This system:

- Conducts zero-knowledge proof KYC checks to ensure each account represents a unique human
- Preserves privacy by never storing personal identification information on-chain
- Creates a one-human-one-account ecosystem without compromising user anonymity

### Anti-Collusion Mechanisms

We employ four complementary strategies to prevent collusion:

1. **Reputation-Based Incentives**: High Impact Score individuals have strong incentives to maintain system integrity, as their accumulated reputation gives them advantages within the ecosystem.
2. **Graduated Penalties**: Those caught engaging in coordinated voting face escalating consequences:
    - First offense: Impact Score reduction
    - Severe or repeated offenses: Permanent platform ban
    - Since KYC verification is required, banned participants cannot simply create new identities
3. **Economic Disincentives**: Our fee structure makes vote-splitting unprofitable:
    - Platform fees decrease with donation size
    - This makes it more expensive to split funds across multiple accounts
4. Implement [Connection-Oriented Cluster Matching](https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/leveling-the-field-how-connection-oriented-cluster-matching-strengthens-quadratic-funding)
    1. **Cluster Detection**: Groups users based on donation patterns and assigns weighted connection values
    2. **Similarity Scoring**: Analyzes connections between donors to identify related groups
    3. **Smart Fund Distribution**: Rewards projects with diverse donor bases while limiting funding for closely connected groups

Together, these mechanisms make collusion economically irrational while preserving legitimate voting influence.

### 2. Multiplying Treasury Impact

The Extended Quadratic Funding model transforms the treasury from the sole funding source to a catalytic multiplier of community resources. Here's how it works:

1. The Cardano treasury allocates a predetermined amount to the matching pool (e.g., $1M)
2. During the funding round, community members make direct donations to projects they support
3. These donations serve two purposes:
    - They provide direct funding to projects (projects keep 100% of direct donations)
    - They determine each project's share of the matching pool
4. The matching formula allocates treasury funds based on both donation amount and distribution:
    - Projects with many small donations receive proportionally more matching funds than those with a few large donations
    - This incentivizes projects to build broad community support rather than courting a few wealthy backers

For example, consider two projects:

- Project A receives 100 donations of $10 each (total: $1,000)
- Project B receives 1 donation of $1,000 (total: $1,000)

Though both raised the same amount, Project A would receive significantly more from the matching pool due to its broader support base—potentially 10× more. 

This mechanism creates powerful incentives:

- **For donors**: Even small donations significantly boost a project's matching allocation
- **For projects**: Building community support becomes as important as securing large contributions
- **For the treasury**: Each allocated ADA potentially mobilizes additional external capital

U.S. donors gain an additional benefit through our 501(c)(3) structure, making donations tax-deductible—creating unique incentives even outside the cryptocurrency ecosystem.

### 3. Standardized Impact Reporting

All projects funded through the Extended Quadratic Funding mechanism must participate in standardized impact reporting. This includes:

1. **Mandatory Impact Accounting**: Each funded project must allocate a small portion of their funding to contract with a designated impact accountant from an approved pool.
2. **Standardized Metrics**: All projects report a core set of ecosystem impact metrics:
    - On-chain transactions generated
    - New wallets created
    - Active users acquired
    - Project-specific KPIs aligned with proposal goals
3. **Regular Reporting Cadence**: Metrics are reported on a standardized schedule:
    - Quarterly reports for one year after project completion
    - Annual reports for commercial projects with revenue-sharing agreements
4. **Public Dashboard**: All impact metrics are published on a public dashboard, creating unprecedented transparency into the outcomes of funded innovation.

This comprehensive reporting system enables:

- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Future funding rounds can be informed by concrete impact data
- **Pattern Recognition**: The community can identify which types of projects deliver the highest ROI
- **Accountability**: Funded teams have clear incentives to demonstrate meaningful ecosystem impact
- **Learning Opportunities**: Unsuccessful projects provide valuable insights alongside successes

### 4. Sustainable Value Capture

To ensure long-term treasury sustainability, we implement a voluntary contribution system where funded projects that achieve commercial success share value with the ecosystem. This operates through several mechanisms:

1. **Equity Agreements**: Commercial startups can offer a small equity stake (typically 1-3%)
2. **Token Allocations**: Projects launching tokens can allocate a portion to the ecosystem (typically 2-5%)
3. **Revenue Sharing**: Commercial applications can contribute a percentage of revenue (typically 1-3%)
4. **Alternative Value**: Some projects may contribute other assets like carbon credits or data access

These contributions flow into a dedicated treasury separate from the main Cardano treasury but governed by the same community. This creates a virtuous cycle where successful projects help fund future innovation.

Our target is to achieve an annual 5% ROI within 10 years across the entire portfolio. While ambitious, this benchmark is actually conservative compared to traditional venture capital expectations, reflecting our balanced approach to funding both public goods and commercial applications.","Since the 501(c)(3) status application process takes approximately 18 months, we are seeking a fiscal sponsor until approval.","### 5. Efficient Milestone Management

Our milestone management system addresses the payment delays and dispute resolution challenges of the current system through a decentralized approach with built-in incentives:

1. **Streamlined Review Process**:
    - Milestone submissions trigger automatic reviewer assignment
    - Reviewers have 5 business days to complete reviews
    - Payment processing begins immediately upon approval
2. **Reviewer Incentives**:
    - Reviewers receive token incentives for prompt, thorough reviews
    - These incentives increase with review quality
    - Reviewers whose decisions are overturned forfeit their incentives
3. **Decentralized Dispute Resolution**:
    - Disputes trigger an escalation to a randomly selected panel of 3 judges
    - The panel's majority decision is final and executes automatically
    - Judges on panels receive additional incentives for participation
    - Full dispute resolution details: https://socious.gitbook.io/whitepaper/decentralized-dispute-resolution

This system creates a self-balancing mechanism that rewards speed and accuracy while providing clear escalation paths when needed. Based on pilot implementation data, we project an average payment processing time of less than 7 days—a dramatic improvement over the current months-long delays.

Extended Quadratic Funding is not intended to replace Project Catalyst but to complement it—creating a more diverse innovation funding ecosystem within Cardano. Just as the introduction of a Rust node alongside the Haskell implementation strengthens Cardano's technical infrastructure through diversity, multiple funding mechanisms create a more resilient innovation landscape.

By addressing the five key limitations of the current system—centralized voting power, limited treasury resources, inadequate impact reporting, unclear return on investment, and inefficient milestone management—Extended Quadratic Funding will unlock new potential within the Cardano ecosystem.

The insights gained through this implementation will not only directly benefit funded projects but also provide valuable data and experience that could inform future improvements to Project Catalyst itself and potentially broader Cardano governance mechanisms like Voltaire.

In an ecosystem built on scientific rigor and evidence-based improvement, Extended Quadratic Funding represents the logical next step in Cardano's funding evolution—maintaining our commitment to decentralization while enhancing effectiveness, transparency, and sustainability.

The Extended Quadratic Funding mechanism is designed as a self-sustaining system that will continue to deliver value to the Cardano ecosystem long after its initial development. Our comprehensive maintenance strategy encompasses multiple funding sources, operational sustainability measures, technical maintenance protocols, and governance evolution.

### Multi-source Funding Model

We will establish a diversified funding approach to ensure financial sustainability beyond the initial treasury allocation:

### 1. External Capital Sources

In addition to treasury funding, we will secure financial support from:

- **High-net-worth individuals**: We have already received preliminary commitments from three blockchain investors interested in supporting innovative funding mechanisms. These individuals will contribute both financial resources and strategic guidance.
- **Corporate partners**: We will establish partnerships with corporations interested in blockchain innovation, particularly those seeking to build applications on Cardano. Partners will contribute annual support in exchange for visibility and early access to promising projects.
- **Philanthropic foundations**: Given our 501(c)(3) structure, we will pursue grants from foundations focused on decentralized governance, financial inclusion, and blockchain innovation. We have identified several foundations with aligned missions and will submit proposals.
- **Development organizations**: International development institutions increasingly recognize blockchain's potential for achieving sustainable development goals. We will pursue partnerships with organizations like USAID, the World Bank, and various UN agencies that have expressed interest in blockchain governance innovations.

### 2. Value Capture from Funded Projects

As outlined in our core proposal, the voluntary contribution mechanism will generate sustainable revenue through:

- **Equity positions** in successful commercial ventures (typically 1-3%)
- **Token allocations** from projects launching new assets (typically 2-5%)
- **Revenue sharing agreements** with profitable applications (typically 1-3%)
- **Other value-generating assets** created by funded projects

### 3. Platform Fee Structure

We will implement a minimal and transparent fee structure: **Donation processing fees**: A sliding scale from 12% (small donations) to 2% (large donations)

These fees are designed to be sustainable rather than profit-maximizing, covering operational costs while remaining significantly lower than traditional venture capital or crowdfunding platforms.

### Operational Sustainability

### 1. Core Team Structure

We will maintain a lean core operation with three primary teams:

- **Project Lead:** 1 FTE project lead overseeing all operations
- **Platform Development:** 4 FTE engineers handling technical maintenance and enhancement
- **Community Engagement:** 1 FTE community manager coordinating with participants and projects
- **Fundraiser:** 1 FTE fundraiser securing external funding

This streamlined team will be supplemented by:

- A network of contracted specialists for specific enhancements
- Community volunteers serving on governance committees
- Project-specific impact accountants (funded through project allocations)

### 2. Knowledge Management and Continuity

To ensure operational continuity:

- All processes will be thoroughly documented in public repositories
- Regular knowledge transfer sessions will prevent single points of failure
- A succession planning framework will identify and develop future leadership
- Community members will be systematically trained to assume increasing responsibility

### 3. Continuous Improvement Framework

We will implement a formalized process for platform evolution:

- Quarterly review cycles to identify improvement opportunities
- Community-driven enhancement proposals
- Annual strategic reassessment to align with ecosystem developments
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Technical Maintenance

### 1. Smart Contract Management

Our smart contract infrastructure will follow industry best practices:

- Multi-signature control for critical contract functions
- Time-lock delays for parameter changes
- Comprehensive test coverage (>95%)
- Regular security audits
- Bug bounty program to incentivize vulnerability disclosure

### 2. Infrastructure Resilience

To ensure continuous operation:

- All critical components will be deployed with redundancy
- Regular disaster recovery testing
- Distributed hosting across multiple geographic regions
- Progressive decentralization of infrastructure components

### Governance Evolution

The governance of the platform itself will progressively decentralize:

### 1. Phase-based Transition

- **Years 1-2**: Professional management with community input
- **Years 3-4**: Hybrid governance with increasing community control
- **Years 5+**: Fully decentralized community governance

### 2. Socious DAO

By Year 3, we will transition maintenance decisions to Socious DAO:

- Voting rights determined by contribution and reputation
- Transparent treasury management
- On-chain decision making for key parameters
- Professional execution of community decisions

### Measuring Maintenance Success

We will track the effectiveness of our maintenance strategy through:

- System uptime and performance metrics
- User satisfaction surveys
- Cost per transaction analysis
- Funding diversity ratios
- Community participation rates
- Governance participation metrics

Regular public reporting on these metrics will ensure transparency regarding maintenance effectiveness and resource utilization.

### Conclusion

The Extended Quadratic Funding model doesn't replace Project Catalyst but complements it, bringing additional funding, greater participation, and enhanced accountability to Cardano's innovation ecosystem. 

We want to emphasize Project Catalyst's remarkable achievements. The Catalyst team carefully listens to community feedback and improves with each round. For example, they removed the downvote feature in response to community input. In Fund 14, Catalyst plans to implement a generalized quadratic voting system. The impact Catalyst has had on the Cardano community cannot be overstated. The challenges mentioned above are common across the industry rather than specific to Catalyst. As noted earlier, the Extended Quadratic Funding model is designed to complement—not replace—Project Catalyst. 

The Extended Quadratic Funding mechanism is designed not just as a project but as a sustainable institution that can serve the Cardano ecosystem for many years. By combining treasury support with diverse external funding, value capture from successful projects, and efficient operations, we will ensure this innovation continues to benefit the community while progressively transitioning to community governance and ownership.

Data shows that, on average, every $1.00 from matching fund donors generates an additional $0.75 in community contributions (source: [Open Source Observer](https://docs.opensource.observer/blog/gitcoin-grants-impact/)). However, effectiveness depends on pool size. Smaller pools (under $250K) typically yield just $0.30 per dollar, while larger pools drive higher participation (source: [Gitcoin Blog](https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/how-to-design-grants-rounds-for-success)). For example, Gitcoin Round 12—their largest to date—raised $6.1M, with $3M from the matching pool and $3.1M from the community (source: [Gitcoin GR12 Results](https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/gr12-results)).
Our strategy is to optimize matching pool efficiency by targeting rounds exceeding $3M, where each dollar in the pool generates at least $1.00 in community funds. For our initial $1M matching pool round, we project $0.50 in community contributions per dollar, setting a strong foundation for growth.

This specific funding request of $1.5M, divided into two rounds ($500k and $1M), is based on research from the Gitcoin ecosystem. On average, every $1.00 contributed by matching fund donors generates an additional $0.75 from the community.

## How do we prevent low voter turnout?

Each round will have a minimum voter turnout threshold—rounds supported by the Cardano treasury will only proceed after receiving at least 3,000 votes.","[{""id"":2111,""prop_link"":""https://shinid.notion.site/A-Catalyst-Alternative-Extended-Quadratic-Funding-Zero-Operational-Costs-1c03d106030b80ac8f00c891a16b3141?pvs=4"",""prop_link_text"":""For additional information, documentation, and videos, please see: ""},{""id"":2112,""prop_link"":""https://socious.org/"",""prop_link_text"":""Website""},{""id"":2114,""prop_link"":""https://socious.gitbook.io/fund"",""prop_link_text"":""Documentation""},{""id"":2113,""prop_link"":""https://shinid.notion.site/1de3d106030b80638e57f69cc0a5721b?pvs=4"",""prop_link_text"":""日本語版 Executive Summary""},{""id"":2115,""prop_link"":""https://shinid.notion.site/Videos-Complement-Catalyst-1df3d106030b80e58d24c0ca89f8691c?pvs=4"",""prop_link_text"":""Videos: https://shinid.notion.site/Videos-Complement-Catalyst-1df3d106030b80e58d24c0ca89f8691c?pvs=4""}]",TRUE,17,2025-04-01T15:03:18.101Z
685,Blockfrost Platform community budget proposal,blockfrost.iog,Core,Company,IOG Singapore Pte Ltd,blockfrost.io,Singapore,,,,marek.mahut@iohk.io,Please see section Introduction of the proposal.,,Please see section Decentralizing Blockfrost of the proposal.,SPO Incentive Improvements,None,Please see section Community Engagement of the proposal.,"# Introduction

Blockfrost is a powerful API platform that gives anyone access to the Cardano Blockchain and functionality without the need to run your own Node.

Our API is designed with developers in mind, and offers tools that remove the complexity of direct node interactions, so anyone can start building on Cardano and launch projects on an afforable, stable and user-friendly framework. 

Blockfrost was originally developed by Five Binaries and is now maintained under the IOG Umbrella.

## Decentralizing Blockfrost

The demand for a reliable infrastructure and tools that support development is what lead to the creating of Blockfrost. If you have interacted witht he Cardano Blockchain, there is a good chance you were interacting with Blockfrost in the background. 

But this level of adoption has come with some trade-offs. At it's peak, Blockfrost was handling over 50% of all on-chain transactions on Cardano. We recognize this concentration is in contrast to the decentralized nature of the blockchain, and have actively been working to decentralize Blockfrost for the benefit of the Cardano community. 

Together with Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) and node operators, we have started the initial phase of what we call the Icebreakers era, an incentivized program designed to decentralize Cardano data access and reward the incredible node operator community.

### The Icebreakers

The Icebreakers is decentralized network of endpoints that allow developers to access Cardano data through a set of reliable node operators, instead of relying on a single centralized source. 

By joining the Icebreaker program, SPOs and other Cardano node operators can monetize their existing infrastructure by processing API requests as part of the Blockfrost network. 


## Deliverables

To ensure transparency and to prevent vendor lock-in, we are open-sourcing all components of the deliverables. This includes the infrastructure, libraries and documentation.

Our primary focus on two key projects: The Blockfrost Platform and the Blockfrost Gateway. Both are designed to expand the capabilities of the Icebreaker network. 

### Blockfrost Platform

The Blockfrost platform is a next-generation backend designed to run on existing SPO relays, utilizing existing resources and rewarding operators with a share of Blockfrost's current revenue by serving our existing customers.

### Blockfrost Gateway

The Blockfrost gateway is the entry point for individual SPOs running the Blockfrost platform. Through the gateway, SPOs can receive requests from Blockfrost users. In return for processing these requests, they earn a share of the revenue. 

With the Blockfrost Gateway, anyone can run their own Blockfrost instance with their own platform. We plan to use Hydra to open micro-payment channels between parties, enabling them to exchange ADA or other tokens for their services.  

We are also developing the Solitary mode, which is designed for teams that require full ownership of their enviroment. Developers and enterprise customers can deploy a customized and independent Blockfrost instance with complete control of the infrastructure, uptime and security.  


## KPIs

Our proposal follows the milestones outlined in the roadmap below. In addition, we commit to the following KPIs: 

* At least 100 active Icebreakers by end of year, 2025
* 100% of transactions submitted through Blockfrost will be handled by the Icebreakers by end of year, 2025
* Quarterly updates provided on the SPO call
* Monthly community development call

## Position with the Cardano Vision and Roadmap for 2025

In March, the majority of DReps voted to adopt the strategic document [Cardano Vision and Roadmap for 2025](https://adastat.net/governances/56f39054758f1a3cedc1de9225d66bf270b62dfdbfbc5399f1d6d43aceffc63600).

Our proposal directly addresses the document's item:

  ""Decentralize data API services to reduce reliance on centralized providers and empower SPOs.""

We are decentralizing the Blockfrost API and increasing the SPO incentives, at the same time.

## Proposed budget

The majority of our budget is allocated to developer salaries. We are requesting an annual budget of $120,000  to support one full-time employee (FTE).

Our total funding request from the treasury is $650,000, which is equivalent to approximately 1,300,000 ADA based on the current rate of 0.50 USD per ADA.

### Team

The team that is working on the deliverble is as follows:

* [Marek](https://github.com/mmahut): Primary project lead (part-time)
* [Beatrice](https://github.com/opacular): Community engagement lead and onboarding (part-time)
* [Vladimir](https://github.com/vladimirvolek): Gateway lead
* [Michal](https://github.com/michalrus): Platform lead
* [Sefa](https://github.com/ginnun): Caching lead
* [Bart](https://github.com/bslabiak): Conformance testing lead


This amounts to total of 5 FTEs.

### Audit

Following the completion of the Icebreaker and Hopper eras, we plan to conduct a security audit of the developed code by a trusted third party. We estimate the cost of this audit to be $50,000.


## Community Engagement

As part of the budget process, we plan to host several recorded community calls for DReps and other community members to discuss this proposal. 

Records of these calls will be posted in [the Github rendered version of this proposal](https://mmahut-2025budget.blockfrost-platform.pages.dev/budget).

## FAQ

- Can I also contribute to these efforts?
  - Definitely! All the deliverables are open-source and we welcome everyone who want to contribute to open an issue on our Github.
- Didn't IOG already post their budget? Why you are not including there?
  - IOE (Input Output Engineering) is a different entity than Blockfrost, therefore we are proposing our own budget.
- Is there any dependency or overlap between this proposal and past Catalyst proposals?
  - There is no dependency or overlap of this proposal with any other Blockfrost proposal. However, there are dependencies that we're using that has been funded by project Catalyst in the future. Pallas is a Rust library that I know have received funding before. We are also going to use Cardano Data nodes such as Dolos that I also know have received funding before too. We are building on shoulders of giants and none of this would be possible without these mature tools.
- Following completion of this proposal, will there be any additional requests to Treasury or Catalyst submissions related to the maintenance of this proposal deliverables, or will this service be self-sustaining once work on this proposal is complete?
  - At this moment, we do not know. As with all software in use, the Blockfrost Platform will also require resources for maintenance. That said, we're in the early stages and are exploring potential other sources of funding. As we are slowly handing over revenue to SPOs, we were thinking perhaps a DAO model, where a portion of the fees goes to the ""Blockfrost treasury,"" could fund this in the future. Full disclosure, we have also discussed a potential token launch that might be used to secure this DAO. However, this is still early and needs discussion with the community too.
- Can you show in some way that 1.3 million ada is a reasonable cost? For example, can you get recommendations from other community developers that this is roughly what it should be, or provide an estimate of the amount of work required?
  - This is an excellent question, and I like the idea of gathering insights from other builderrs in the community. I'm not certain if this is the optimal approach, but we have posted a call for opinions on our Twitter, and I hope we will receive valuable feedback on this topic. The discussion is happening at [this thread](https://x.com/blockfrost_io/status/1913567785659023740).
- Will anyone be able to run an Icebreaker, or does this needs approval from Blockfrost? Will there be a limit on the number of Icebreakers?
  - At the moment, this is limited by a NFT license (that we provide for free, we just want to have contact information of which SPO is running which node, all one need is just to fill up a form to get one), given we're just in beta testing phase. When the beta testing is over, anyone will be able to join the clusters - not only SPOs but also full wallet users. Additionally, I think an important note is that anyone would be able to run their entire Blockfrost gateway cluster and ""their own"" Icebreakers. I envision that groups of SPOs might get together and start their own clusters with their own pricing, SLAs, endpoints etc and start to compete. We are also researching how we could have a decentralized P2P marketplace for Icebreakers to offer their services (imagine just setting the price per request on your Icebreaker, starting it and it will just connect to a cluster without you having to choose one) - but this is out of scope for this year as much more research needs to be done.
- How will the revenue sharing model for Icebreakers be structured? Specifically, could you elaborate on how the share of Blockfrost revenue will be calculated and distributed to participating node operators?
  - The pricing will be per request. When you look at our website, the price customer pays for 1M requests is around ~4 ADA. At the moment, we are rewarding Icebreakers with a minimum of 20 USD in ADA monthly, as the traffic to them is still small (under 20 USD), but as soon that traffic increases, they will be paid what they have served. In the future, when the full traffic is going to be handled fully in decentralized way, we will introduce a tax parameter, that will take a cut of all revenue and allocate it to the Blockfrost gateway to fund the infrastructure and administrative fees for running it. I imagine people will compete in a way that will start new Gateways with lower taxes to attract the Icebreakers. We are also investigating a possible DAO for this, but this is still in research and out of scope for this 2025 proposal.

As it grows, more dApps and users join, the demand for processing capacity increases, leading to congestion, slower transaction times, and higher fees.",,"zkFold will develop and implement ZK rollups on Cardano to scale it efficiently, promoting broader adoption and supporting an ecosystem of decentralized applications and services.
Overall, our proposal will have the following positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem:
- Improved Scalability: ZK rollups enable Cardano to process significantly more transactions per second (TPS) by bundling and verifying transactions off-chain. This reduces congestion, benefiting users by ensuring faster and more efficient dApp interactions.
- Lower Transaction Costs: By reducing the number of transactions directly processed on-chain, ZK rollups lower the transaction fees, making Cardano more accessible and affordable, especially for smaller transactions or micro-payments.
- Enhanced User Experience: Lower fees create a smoother experience for users interacting with dApps, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and NFT marketplaces.
- Increased Adoption: ZK rollups can make the Cardano ecosystem more attractive for developers and users, promoting the growth of dApps, DeFi, and other blockchain applications by offering higher performance and scalability.
- Maintained Security: ZK rollups allow for scalability improvements without compromising the security and decentralization of the Cardano base layer, as Cardano still plays the role of the settlement layer for the rollup transactions.",L2 Expansion,Technical Steering Committee,We are already developing the ZK Rollup on Cardano with our own funding and our goal is to release a testnet asap.,"ZK rollups address the scalability problem. Hundreds of transactions can be submitted as a single batch, reducing the load on the L1. Cardano can achieve higher throughput and lower transaction costs.

zkFold offers to build a general-purpose zero knowledge rollup solution for Cardano. A zero knowledge rollup is a technological layer (Layer 2) on top of a blockchain that increases the blockchain’s scalability potential by compressing many transactions into transaction batches. As batches offer a greater degree of information compression, it is reasonable to expect that hundreds of rollup smart contract transactions might fit into a single Cardano mainnet transaction. Zero knowledge proofs technology places a limit on the cost of on-chain verification of the validity of transaction batches. Specifically, the batch verification fits well within the Execution Unit limits set at the protocol level, as demonstrated by the prototype created by the zkFold team",None,We have included maintenance costs into the projects´s budget,"Milestones:

We also need to attract more people to the ecosystem, whether its investors, developers or users. Exhibitions are often a key part of all of these audiences decision making when choosing where to base themselves. ",,The funds will provide a partial subsidy to projects so they can afford to be present at exhibitions that will benefit them. Part of the funding will enable us to be able to provide support to the projects to ensure they get the most out of the event.,It doesn't align,Marketing Committee,"Over the last 6 weeks, I have been socialising and refining the proposal based on community feedback in Discord and twitter spaces. 

Here is a link to a tweet where I have asked for the community to record their endorsement: 

https://x.com/invalid_eutxo/status/1908166826095194154
","We propose to host Ecosystem Pavilions at numerous Exhibitions around the world. The funding will ensure that projects are able to have access to much more affordable prices to have a presence at the event. Non of the spots or travel budgets will be 100% funded. We will also be ensuring that projects that sign up understand the importance of pre event work, during the event work and follow up work to achieve the best possible ROI. The aim is that it will give projects a more affordable entry and education into how to truly make the most of exhibitions and marketing. 

Please visit out website for a more thorough breakdown and explanation:","This proposal has no other funding dependancies. Discover Cardano staff that would be involved in these events are already in place and is self funded and working on other aspects right now. If this proposal gets funded,  It will likely drive the priority/order of what content is created and when to fit in with the timelines for each event. ","After the events have taken place, one of the things we will be doing is asking projects to provide feedback on the effectiveness and we will provide support to them all to ensure follow ups are done etc.. Again, the staff that would do this are employed by Discover Cardano already.

Regarding the Dispersal of subsidies, we will require projects that sign up to initially provide the funds for their pod spot, then they provide us with the booking payment confirmations for flights and hotel and they receive the amount they are entitled to by the end of the month (as long as they submit before the 20th of each month, otherwise it will be paid the end of the following month.)
 ","The Pavilions need to be paid for as far in advance as possible to ensure the best price and position is achieved. So the majority of the funds will need to be released upon successful application confirmation. But from a milestone POV, we will be providing plenty of proof that the event took place, along with Follow up calls etc and KPI gathering. 

In terms of Monetary ROI/KPIs: 

$839k ask is for partial subsidy for projects to fund Travel and prvide much more accessible exhibition options. The value of which is $839k.
We believe we can achieve a CAC of $140 per user which is well below industry average of $239. 
this is based on 6k new users onboarded directly from the events using Proof of onboarding tokens

We would like to see that there are at least 50 Projects that will be able to utilise this project and that after the end of the year, they can attest in person to the benefits of exhibiting at the right events for their platform. 

On top of that, at least 2 of our staff will be walking the events and doing short surveys with visitors, designed to gauge peoples knowledge of Cardano ecosystem. As the year progresses, we aim to see an uptick in peoples knowledge of the opportunity that Cardano represents. (Beyond just knowing ADA is a top 10 Crypto)","Personally I have 15 years experience at over 75 exhibitions and conferences around the world in various industries. I have also in the past benefited from Industry and Government Grant subsidy schemes for such activities. So I am employing the best fit here into my proposal for where we currently are as a young and developing ecosystem with very little marketing support to date. 

We have previously had a largely self funded booth at a crypto event in 2023 as well as a satellite event at DIFC to the Cardano Summit where we gave 14 projects the opportunity to present themselves on stage in front of TradFi innvoation teams like HSBC/Standard chartered and others.

The original Cardano roadmap, set by Cardano’s founders, ended with the age of Voltaire. Now it’s time to define an open, shared, and transparent process for the Cardano community to define a long-term vision and a roadmap.

--

Creating a long-term vision in a small group is not easy, and it gets more complex as more stakeholders participate. One of Cardano’s strengths is its community-shared mind, so the challenge is to define a reusable process to leverage Cardano’s shared mind to create a long-term vision for Cardano and make it operational.

--

Furthermore, as Cardano advances toward a maturing ecosystem, its future hinges on informed decision-making. However, the ecosystem currently lacks a dedicated, rigorous, and consolidated product research function to guide these decisions across themes such as user adoption, developer onboarding, governance participation, competitive positioning, and broader awareness. This absence limits our ability to reliably measure barriers, understand emerging needs, and identify product-market fit opportunities.

--

Cardano overall, and builders across the ecosystem, operate without a shared, research-backed understanding of what users actually need or how to prioritize strategic direction. Existing insights are scattered or outdated, and there is no ecosystem-wide standard for how assumptions are challenged or validated. This creates the risk of fragmentation as well as solutions that don’t address real user pain points or market gaps.","The proposal supports the effort to create the first community-driven 2030 vision and 2026 roadmap, as well as creating a reusable framework to keep user and market insights updated.

--

These effort to collect qualitative and quantitative insights, draft and ratify a 2030 vision and a 2026 roadmap is supported by:

-   The initial [product research questions](https://productcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/committee-outcomes/2025-proposed-research-budget#proposed-items-1), which are aligned with all [five goals](https://productcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/committee-outcomes/2025-cardanos-roadmap/2025-proposed-cardano-goals) defined by the Cardano community during the first consultation period, including but not limited to the following:
    

    -   Get more usage: Research will identify successful and failed use cases, reasons behind adoption and churn, and which transaction types drive sustained engagement.
    
    -   Make Cardano easier to build on and use: Interviews and usability tests will reveal friction in current tooling and onboarding flows for both L1 and L2.
    
    -   Make Cardano competitive: Market and competitor analysis will highlight where Cardano leads or lags in developer and enterprise adoption.
    
    -   Clear funding mechanisms: Ecosystem-wide mapping of current funding models, barriers to access, and comparative models from other chains will offer clarity.
    
    -   Increase recognition: Behavioral studies and surveys will assess awareness of Cardano among users and enterprises.
    

-   The open process for a shared community-driven vision, which enables:
    

    -   Creation and facilitation of a repeatable process for community engagement and ratification
    
    -   Enabling collaborative creation of long-term objectives and implementation eras
    
    -   Structuring the translation of research insights into strategic deliverables
    
    -   Providing documentation, rationale, and a framework that ensures transparency and reuse
    

--

Furthermore, it aligns deeply with the Roadmap’s focus on community participation, decentralization, and ecosystem alignment.","The outcome of this proposal is a 2030 community-driven vision for Cardano, a 2026 proposed roadmap, and the first consolidated product research effort in Cardano. This will be achieved by providing clear paths for the broader Cardano community to participate in the 2030 vision creation process—both by contributing insights as key stakeholders and by enabling the collection of additional input through structured user and customer interviews, along with targeted product research initiatives.

Key Outcomes and value this proposal will deliver:

-   Broad community participation in the first community-driven Cardano vision creation process
    
-   Documented insights from the community shared brain
    
-   Documented insights from key groups (such as SPOs, builders, and businesses in and outside of Cardano and Blockchain)
    
-   Participation in creating and critiquing the first draft proposal for a 2030 Cardano vision
    
-   Creation of the first framework and consolidated data set of insights coming from product research guiding Cardano (and builders on Cardano) on what are the most prominent user needs and the key market opportunities
    
-   Opportunities to access funding to run product research initiatives
    
-   Identify promising focus areas for Cardano to achieve product-market-fit, which can be coordinated with the Technical Steering Committee of Intersect to ultimately identify mission-critical Cardano feature sets",It supports the product roadmap,Product Committee,"The proposal is based on 7 months of consultation run by the Cardano Product Committee of Intersect. It aligns with the broader goals defined by the community in the initial consultation ([here](https://productcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/committee-outcomes/2025-cardanos-roadmap/2025-proposed-cardano-goals)), and it aligns with the original Cardano budget submitted on [Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/t/cardano-research-budget-proposal/143044/10) (which had prior community support via open consultation)

--

Furthermore, this process has already started, and the community has been actively participating via workshops, focus group calls, and surveys (initial documentation [here](https://productcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/committee-outcomes/2030-long-term-cardano-vision)).","
#### Overview

One of the key community goals in 2025 is to create a shared long-term vision, transitioning from the roadmap created by Cardano’s founders to a community-led dynamic vision and yearly roadmap.

--

To create the first community driven 2030 Cardano vision, and a following 2026 roadmap, the Cardano Product Committee of Intersect, via consultation, has drafted a strategy (which is already operational) which includes both broad consultation via workshops (remote and in-person) and focused insights collection via focus group calls, with key ecosystem stakeholders (like SPOs) and businesses (both in Cardano and outside Cardano), and incentivized structured user and market research with an initial set of broad questions divided by the broad Cardano [goals](https://productcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/committee-outcomes/2025-cardanos-roadmap/2025-proposed-cardano-goals).

  

#### About 2030 vision process and in-depth product research

##### 2030 vision process

To draft a community-driven proposed 2030 vision, the Committee has defined a 4-step phases (currently in progress):

1.  Insight Collection
    

    -   Community workshops (up to 100 globally, online and in-person)
    
    -   Collection of qualitative insights on user pain points, ecosystem opportunities, and desired 2030 outcomes
    
    -   Documentation and analysis of insights gathered
    

2.  Drafting the Vision Proposal
    

    -   Synthesis of insights into key objectives for 2030
    
    -   Structuring of broad eras to achieve those objectives
    
    -   Incorporation of existing research, SWOT analysis, academic reports, and ecosystem data
    

3.  Community Review & Iteration
    

    -   Public virtual workshops to critique the draft vision
    
    -   Naming of eras, prioritization of deliverables
    
    -   Final refinements based on feedback
    

4.  On-chain Submission
    

    -   Ratification via community info action
    
    -   Public release of the final vision document and supporting research archive
    

--

The process above will provide qualitative insights from consultations, which will also be available to the whole community for reference and to act as guidance.  
To facilitate more and more of these discussions the committee is providing support to run remote workshops, however, knowing how important in-person discussions are when brainstorming a vision, and to collect regional insights, the committee has identified a need to incentivize small gatherings, possibly in existing events, which will generate extremely valuable insights during the first step and great critiques during the third step.

--

In particular, we aim to provide support to local discussions via small rewards up to ADA 500 to anyone who meets in their own region and documents the insights gathered. The local element will emphasise the regional insights and help the committee (and the broader community) to find use cases and opportunities in different regions and markets. We also aim to give support via small rewards of up to ADA 1000 to anyone who will run structured workshops with more than 10 attendees.  

--

Basic acceptance criteria to access these funds will include:

-   Anyone running a small ad-hoc gathering or a structured workshop will need to create a Luma event and add it to the Luma [Product committee calendar](https://lu.ma/intersectProductCommittee)
    
-   Send the 2030 Vision consultation [survey](https://forms.gle/nF8YwWBTomvT5scj6)
    
-   Hosts of small ad-hoc gatherings need to take notes and compile a report with key insights
    
-   Hosts of structured workshops need to ensure participants have access to the provided Miro template, and during the session, they should collect notes as well as compile a report with key insights
    

--  
  

Since the end of 2024, the Cardano Product Committee of Intersect has already started to work through this by:

-   Creating a first version of a repeatable process (documented [here](https://productcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/committee-outcomes/2030-long-term-cardano-vision))
    
-   Opening a wide consultation via survey ([here](https://productcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/committee-outcomes/2030-long-term-cardano-vision))
    
-   Running open remote, and in-person workshops ([here](https://productcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/committee-outcomes/2030-long-term-cardano-vision/insights-collection-workshops))
    
-   Running focus groups with SPOs and builders/businesses ([here](https://productcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/committee-outcomes/2030-long-term-cardano-vision/focus-group-calls))
    

  

##### In-depth Product Research

To answer more detailed questions in relation to user needs and market opportunities the committee has collected, via open consultation, an initial set of broad questions which aims to expand and answer by incentivizing and funding the first consolidated user and market research effort in Cardano, creating a framework and opening the way to continuous product insights collection (bringing that to the same quality and standards of Cardano’s academic research).

--

For year 1, 2025, the research conducted aims to provide insights into the direction and refinement of the proposed goals for 2025 and support builders (as well as other committees in Intersect) with information on user needs. In addition to this initial need, the insights from this first year will directly inform the Cardano strategy for 2025 and 2026 and help create a longer-term vision. The outcome of this research will also lead to clear problem statements, which will be documented as Cardano Problem Statements (CPSs).

--

The initiative aims to produce validated Cardano Problem Statements (CPSs), evidence-based recommendations, and qualitative and quantitative user and market insights to reach and get closer to five strategic goals (documented [here](https://productcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/committee-outcomes/2025-cardanos-roadmap/2025-proposed-cardano-goals) in more detail):

1.  Get more usage
    
2.  Make Cardano easier to build on and use
    
3.  Make Cardano a competitive option
    
4.  Create clear funding mechanisms
    
5.  Make Cardano more recognizable
    
--


It will also support the underlying vision of creating a shared, community-driven path for Cardano’s growth through 2030. The results will be published in public repository to ensure reusability and transparency. The research will:

-   Identify bottlenecks in tooling, onboarding, and documentation
    
-   Validate which use cases Cardano is best suited for (and which it's not)
    
-   Map personas and journeys for dApp teams, enterprises, and community members
    
-   Clarify gaps in governance awareness and participation
    
-   Offer comparative insights from other ecosystems to identify opportunities
    

--

The Product Committee has analysed and documented in detail, also building on the successful workshop methodologies implemented in Paris, Florida International University, and Japan :

-   [High-level Skillset and expertise](https://productcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/committee-outcomes/2025-proposed-research-budget#high-level-skillset-and-expertise-required-1) required to run this research
    
-   [Broad acceptance criteria](https://productcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/committee-outcomes/2025-proposed-research-budget#broad-acceptance-criteria-1) for the overall Product research effort, which include:
    

    -   Expert-led, rigorous research
    
    -   Transparent and timely dissemination
    
    -   Validated and ecosystem-aligned
    

-   [An initial set of questions](https://productcommittee.docs.intersectmbo.org/committee-outcomes/2025-proposed-research-budget#proposed-items-1) for each of the five broad goals that, once answered, will help determine the most effective direction to take in order to achieve them

--

All data collected via this process will be hosted in a public repository. This initial framework will then be repeated and refined year after year to keep the vision updated.","Concerning community consultation for the 2030 Vision creation process, this proposal aims to deliver rich and diverse documented input and insights from the broader Cardano community to support the drafting of the first community-driven long-term vision for Cardano, as well as through critique and feedback for the future draft proposal for the 2030 Cardano vision.

--

Expected deliverables:

-   Up to 100 workshops supported
    
-   Documented insights
    
-   Documented feedback and critiques of the 2030 vision proposal which will be based on the insights
    
-   Overall community engagement and support for the future 5-year vision
    

--

Concerning the first consolidated product research effort for Cardano, this proposal aims to deliver an initial simple process, a strategy to answer and expand the questions documented above, and a set of structured research initiatives opportunities to be allocated with funding to product researchers in Cardano. These will deliver:

-   Research initiatives based on the initial research questions outlined to be allocated via an open and transparent tender process
    
-   A scalable and open framework to consolidate the Insights collected documenting them in a public repo for broader community consumption
    
-   Key insights socialised and used to inform the 2030 Cardano Vision draft proposal and 2026 roadmap proposal","This is not a development proposal. Research initiatives will be assigned to either people or teams who apply to run them. The product committee is already running workshops and focus groups, alongside initial outcomes from this. First results are expected in Q3 2025, and the overall key insights are expected to be collected and analyzed by Q4 2025.

--


In relation to the vision creation process, the Cardano Product Committee members are already running this process. They aim to support with these funding up to 100 small workshops over the course Q2, Q3, and Q4 of 2025.","The Cardano Product Committee of Intersect is made of members’ elected product experts with knowledge in business, market research, and user research. The committee is also supported by academic researchers and it will consult Subject Matter Experts to define research initiatives and allocate fund in an open and transparent process to expert providers, as well as to properly document and share all the collected insights.",Milestone Based Fixed Price,750000,0.5,United States Dollar,375000,"
### 2030 vision process

In relation to the first consolidated Cardano Product research question the Cardano Product Committee requests a budget of $200k to get insights related to the research questions (described in the full proposal here), plus any other questions that will be brought to the committee from other committees in 2025, as well as to cover costs for managing the process and making the outcome easily accessible to the community, with a commitment to return any unused remaining funds to the treasury.

--

The budget will be roughly allocated as follows:

-   $5000 will be allocated to an individual or a team to expand the initial research questions and structure a full product research strategy, dividing the research effort into defined initiatives with a recommended strategy for each
    
-   $12000 x 15 research initiatives to cover answering questions related to the 5 goals, with a focus on identifying user pain points and needs as well as market opportunities (particularly on a regional level, for example, on emerging markets in Africa and Latin America or other underexposed regions)
    
-   $5000 to document and analyse all the insights gathered and make them available in the pre-defined framework, and open a potential new Cardano Problem Statement
    
-   5% ($10000) committee contingent overhead to manage the process
    
-- 

### In-depth Product Research

In relation to the 2030 vision creation insight collection and consultation, the Cardano Product Committee is budgeting for up to 100 ad-hoc gatherings and workshops (in-person and remote), coming to a total of $175k with a commitment to return the remaining funds to the treasury, at the end of the vision creation process, if the funds are not fully spent. We don’t see a need for professional services as we’re going to be developing this in an open-source volunteer fashion. These gatherings and local workshops will also give a stronger focus on collecting regional insights, both about broader Cardano evolution depending on the regional perspective and about regional use cases and opportunities for Cardano.

  

The budget will be roughly allocated as follows:

-   $50k towards retroactive reimbursement of anyone who wants to run an in-person local ad-hoc gathering or structured vision creation workshops - up to 100 sessions
    
-   $25k towards retroactive reimbursement of structured discovery business/development sessions to gather insights - up to 10 sessions
    
-   $100k to support the overall facilitation of local structured in-person larger workshops with Product experts' attendance, aiming to group workshops in series of 3 by location - up to 20 workshops. Target focus area for potential options:
    

    -   Africa (Nigeria, Kenya, Cameroon, Uganda
    

    -   Latam (Equador, Chile, Argentina, Colombia- Medellin, Uruguay, Paraguay)
    

    -   North America (Quebec, Wyoming, Florida, Colorado, Pennsylvania)
    

    -   Europe (Germany, Norway, Ireland, Switzerland)
    

    -   Australia (Sidney, Perth, Melbourne)
    

    -   Asia (Hong-Kong, Vietnam, Japan, Philippines, Sri-Lanka, Singapore)
    

--
  

Example of budget breakdown for a series of workshops over 4 days in one location might include:

-   $4000 for 2x product experts' travel costs
    
-   $3000 for 2x Product experts’ lodging costs and expenses
    
-   $4500 for 3x venue for 3 separate workshops
    
-   $3000 for 3x workshops for food and refreshments
    
-   $3000 for 2x fixed stipend

637,ZK Bridge,eryxracoon,Core,Company,Eryx Cooperativa,eryx.co,Argentina,,,,crypto-racoons@eryxsoluciones.com.ar,"Cross-chain interoperability remains one of the most critical yet unresolved challenges for Cardano. While the ecosystem is advancing in scalability through projects like Hydra and optimistic roll ups such as Midgard it still lacks a secure, trustless, and modular zk-based bridges infrastructure.
Current bridges rely on centralized validators or multi-signature schemes, introducing major security risks—as demonstrated by numerous high-profile exploits in other ecosystems. Without a native zero-knowledge bridge, Cardano is unable to safely connect with external chains, severely limiting access to external liquidity, composability with other ecosystems, and the ability to scale horizontally.

Furthermore, the Cardano ecosystem lacks a unified open-source toolkit for:
On-chain verification of zero-knowledge proofs
Secure and efficient cross-chain messaging
Asset wrapping and unwrapping under Cardano’s native token model
And trust-minimized interoperability with existing ZK-rollups.

This absence puts Cardano at a competitive disadvantage compared to platforms like Ethereum, which already benefit from multiple zk-based Layer 2 solutions and zk-enabled bridges.
A modular zkBridge is not only critical to unlock interoperability—it also lays the groundwork for a future Cardano-native zkRollup framework, by enabling the testing and deployment of foundational components such as provers, verifiers, and state synchronization mechanisms.",,"Building a zero-knowledge bridge provides several key benefits to the Cardano ecosystem. A bridge between Cardano and other blockchains would make it much easier for value to flow in from external ecosystems, increasing the liquidity available within Cardano.
A zero-knowledge bridge, specifically, offers important advantages over alternative architectures such as optimistic bridges. In a ZK bridge, a single user action accompanied by a succinct proof of deposit is sufficient to release tokens on the destination blockchain. This eliminates the need for community-wide monitoring or challenge periods, significantly reducing latency and trust assumptions.
Additionally, by building a ZK bridge, Cardano positions itself as a more interoperable platform, capable of engaging with the broader ecosystem of zero-knowledge technologies. This lays the groundwork for future innovations in identity, privacy-preserving applications, and cross-chain collaboration.",L2 Expansion,Technical Steering Committee,The need for ZK solutions in Cardano has been increasingly voiced by the community across multiple forums. There is strong interest in the Cardano ecosystem to support a ZkBridge framework.,"Our proposal is building a ZK bridge for Cardano, which we will deploy on the Cardano testnet.
As part of this initiative, we will define a communication protocol for the bridge, provide the full source code of the smart contracts on the Cardano side, and produce comprehensive technical documentation detailing the protocol between Cardano and any other isomorphic blockchain. 
We will provide a circuit that enables a relayer to generate the ZK proof that a locking transaction was successfully added to the chain, which can then be verified on the receiving blockchain. This way, any blockchain will be able to implement a ZK bridge with Cardano, leveraging its newly added capability to generate such proofs. This allows for a variety of uses, such as moving assets outside Cardano just by providing the proof that they’ve locked an equivalent amount in the Cardano Smart Contract. The resulting bridge can serve as a generic framework for interoperability between Cardano and any other blockchain willing to implement the corresponding counterpart contracts.
Furthermore, we will implement contracts in Aiken to mint assets on a Cardano-like (isomorphic) blockchain and deploy them on the Cardano testnet, providing a fully functional proof of concept. These building blocks will enable developers to create bridges between Cardano and other chains with minimal additional effort. ",no dependencies,"

502,Scalus - DApps Development Platform,okhodakivskyi,Core,Company,Lantr,lantr.io,France,,,,X: @atlanter  Github: nau,"Building DApps on Cardano remains harder than it should be. New developers need to invest a substantial amount of time to become productive. It makes Cardano less attractive to build on, and limits the ability to innovate and produce value to end users.

New developers face multiple obstacles:
1. Steep technical learning curve
2. Fragmented technology stack (on-chain/off-chain, front-end/back-end)
3. Limited development tooling and standard libraries
4. Scattered educational resources

In anticipation of the wider adoption of Cardano technology by traditional organisations (e.g., in finance and fintech, where Java and Scala are dominant), it should be simpler for their web2 developers to start building on Cardano. Companies need a smooth path for their existing teams — without the need to learn new programming languages or hire specialists just to get started.",,"(1) Benefits for professionals

536,A free Native Asset CDN for Cardano Developers,nftcdn,None of these,Company,NFTCDN LTD,nftcdn.io,United Kingdom,,,,[NFTCDN Twitter](https://x.com/nftcdn_io) | [NFTCDN Discord](https://discord.nftcdn.io) | [Email Us](mailto:contact@nftcdn.io),"# Background - Native Assets
- Native assets (NFTs & FTs) are widely used on Cardano across diverse use cases
- Often used to store multimedia content - images, music, videos, documents, etc
- Media is stored on decentralised systems - IPFS, Arweave, and on-chain embeds
- Centralised storage options also used - HTTP, FTP & commercial cloud providers
- File locations are referenced as links within the native asset’s metadata

# Pain Point - Technical Complexity
- Accessing native asset media requires querying the blockchain (Cardano node + DB-Sync)
- And fetching content via middleware (e.g. IPFS gateway/node)
- Apps must handle this process programmatically, at scale, with robust exception handling
- Developers face challenges from:
    - Human error (e.g. typos in metadata links)
    - Evolving standards (e.g. NFT v0.01, CIP-25, CIP-68)
    - Protocol updates (e.g. Chang HF impacting Node & DB-Sync)
- Performance, efficiency, and reliability must be maintained across all layers
- Apps must build and maintain complex, resilient backend infrastructure to support native asset display as both a capability & feature

# Solution – NFTCDN
- NFTCDN is a managed Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) provider
- Provides high-availability native asset media & metadata delivery via globally distributed, high-speed Content Delivery Network

# How is NFTCDN different from a basic CDN (e.g. Cloudflare, Vercel, etc)
- **NFTCDN is purpose-built for Cardano**: NFTCDN is more than a CDN. Direct API access to `/metadata`, `/image`, `/file` native assets using only their fingerprint ID. Cloudflare offers no blockchain/NFT support; this would have to be custom built by devs.
- **Multi-protocol/system support**: NFTCDN auto-handles multimedia storage fetching from IPFS, Arweave, HTTP, on-chain. Cloudflare requires devs to build fetch/parsing logic manually on their own infra setup.
- **Standards-aware infra**: NFTCDN supports CIP-25, 68, v0.01 and adapts as they evolve. Cloudflare has no protocol awareness - devs must implement parsing module compliance manually and cater for human error and edge cases.
- **No infra required**: NFTCDN handles full resolution flow (parsing, error fall-back, and format support) out of the box. Cloudflare needs origin setup and content pre-hosted on their proprietary solutions.
- **Real-time chain indexing**: Native assets state updated live (minting & updating) from chain. Cloudflare requires manual indexing, pointer mgmt, and cache invalidation.
- **Cloudflare TOS risk**: Large or non-web file caching (image, audio, video, 3D files) is restricted; in-production use will violate TOS unless using proprietary paid products (Stream/Images/R2, c. ~$5k+/yr).    
- **Global cross-app caching**: NFTCDN caches assets at the asset level, so cache `HITS` benefit all products (websites & dApps). Cloudflare caches per domain/site - no sharing resulting in low CDN performance resulting in higher cache `MISS` states.
- **Built-in content safety**: NFTCDN provides CSP headers + dev. controls over rendering. Cloudflare lacks native asset-specific safeguards, increasing risk of suspension due to embedded malicious multimedia content.",Service Level Agreement,605000,0.5,British Pound Sterling,242000,"# Cost Breakdown - 1+18 months duration

Historically, the functional programming paradigm of Haskell and Plutus has scared away new developers. Aiken, Plu-ts and similar alternatives are also based on functional programming. Moreover all of these languages are rare, some specifically designed for Cardano Contracts. Thus, if developers want to start building for Cardano, they need to to learn a completely new language.",,"We propose OpShin, a Python-based smart contract language for Cardano. Python is one of the most popular programming languages known. On top of this we provide the security guarantees that are the reason for the Cardano community to embrace functional programming - thus offering an accessible and easy to start with alternative to current languages.

OpShin is aimed at developers that want to build on Cardano. It drastically simplifies onboarding when experience in Python is given, and even without is easy to read and access. 

By making development of Smart Contracts more accessible, OpShin is a key catalyst for a growing ecosystem of DApps on Cardano. The benefit to community is immense.",Developer / User Experience,Open Source Committee,"OpShin and its related project have in the past received 6 Catalyst Grands over 4 Funds, showing continued support from the community. OpShin has also contributed to various CIP discussions about Smart Contract standards have been discussed.","This is OpShin: a toolchain that lets developers construct Cardano smart contracts in Python.  The toolchain comprises several projects that aim to facilitate the development of Smart Contracts and dApps on Cardano. They are largely based on Python, or integrate well with it for maximal accessibility. On top of accessibility, OpShin ensures low transaction cost compared to PlutusTx.

At the time of writing, Python is the second-most used language on GitHub, with 14.75% of the active userbase working with Python, and enjoys a 22.5% year-over-year increase in users; this is driven in part by its utility in data science and machine learning.

# Introduction

Elliptic curves, specifically over Galois
fields, have found multiple uses in blockchain applications. 
One particularly significant application is zero-knowledge proofs, which promise
significant capability enhancements, ranging from better onchain performance to
new operations. To this end, a whole constellation of different elliptic curves,
based on a huge range of Galois fields, have been proposed and designed. These
vary in their mathematical properties, intended use cases, and other features,
while still being broadly similar in terms of their basic foundations. Such
curves include, but aren't limited to:

* The Pasta curves
* The Grumpkin curve
* BLS12-381

This list is not complete, and is likely to grow larger as time passes. In
general, every blockchain, and its respective software ecosystem, tends to
settle on a different choice of elliptic curve(s) and associated Galois fields.

Plutus is no exception to this. Currently, there are no fewer than eight CIPs, in
various stages of adoption, which either directly, or indirectly, justify their
proposed extensions to Plutus by way of elliptic curves, finite field
arithmetic, or both:

* [CIP-0049]
* [CIP-0058]
* [CIP-0101]
* [CIP-0121]
* [CIP-0122]
* [CIP-0123]
* [CIP-0133]
* [CIP-0381]
 
These proposals are self-evidently useful, as shown by most of them being
adopted into Plutus Core. However, for an application developer who wants to
work over a specific elliptic curve, all of these proposed improvements suffer
from one of two problems. 

The first of these problems, as typified by CIP-0058, is an excess of
generality. You are given the pieces to (possibly) build the curve functionality
you need, but no help beyond that. This means a lot of work, likely involving
expertise (and concerns) far outside your domain of interest or knowledge.
Furthermore, you now become responsible for security considerations around
elliptic curve use. Lastly, if multiple application developers need logic around
a specific curve, this may end up being re-implemented multiple times by
different teams. None of these make the process _straightforward_, and in many
cases might be a hard obstacle to a working product even if it's technically
possible.

The second problem, typified by CIP-0381, is an excess of specificity. If an
application developer wants to work over a specifically-supported curve (such as
BLS12-381 in this case), this is a blessing from the correctness, optimization
and security point of view. However, if this isn't the curve they need, they are
left out in the cold. While it is conceivable for an application developer to
request the curve they need to have direct support in Plutus Core similar to
BLS12-381, this is impractical at best, and creates all the issues discussed
previously regarding incidental complexity and requiring expertise from other
domains.

Furthermore, there is an unspoken problem of having application developers being
forced to own the underlying primitives for their curve implementations. If
issues of performance or security are discovered, or even if some more
operations or generality are needed, the application developers must provide the
upgrade path. This can range from difficult to impossible, and must be
engineered for ahead of time. This just compounds the difficulties involved,
especially for developers who are not experts in either cryptographic security
or onchain performance.

# Our solution

We will create a two-part proof-of-concept system, named Grumpelstilskin, designed 
to allow application developers to easily use any curve of their choice for
zero-knowledge proof verification on-chain. The first part of Grumpelstilskin
will be a 'working script' which, when given appropriate parameters via its
datum, will verify a zero-knowledge proof over a user-specified curve. This
script will be tested for correctness.

The second part of Grumpelstiltskin will be a YTxP-based interface to
the 'working script', implemented in Plutarch. This interface will be
well-documented, easy to use, and flexible, with a focus of making life easy for
application developers who want to use zero-knowledge proofs. Thanks to our use
of YTxP, future performance, security and functionality improvements will not be
the responsibility of application developers who use Grumpelstilskin. This
second part will be distributed as an open-source project. 

We aim to build a minimum viable product, with the future goals of expanded
functionality, improved performance, as well as a full audit of the 'working
script'. Our choice of YTxP will make it minimally difficult to achieve this,
and will impose minimal friction on any application developers using
Grumpelstiltskin to build their products.

","Post-development, MLabs will maintain the tool under its open-source library suite. Enhancements to add aiken will be proposed via Catalyst and Intersect maintenance requests. Bug fixes and integration support will be provided for 6 months post-release.","We describe the structure of the proposed work below. 

## Milestone 1: Key Galois field operations in Plutarch

We will implement key operations over user-parameterized Galois fields in
Plutarch. To achieve this generality, we will implement the following:

1. A representation of elements of a user-specified Galois field.
2. Field operations over the representation in 1.
3. Exponentiation operation over the representation in 1.

We will also write tests for general correctness of these operations, without a
specific field in mind. These tests will be done at the script level, rather
than the transaction level.

## Milestone 2: Key elliptic curve operations in Plutarch

We will implement key operations over user-parameterized elliptic curves. These
will use the work in Milestone 1 for Galois fields. For elliptic curves, we will
allow user-chosen curve constants, and well as user-chosen base and scalar
fields. To achieve this generality, we will need to implement the following:

1. A representation of points on user-specified elliptic curves, using the
   Galois field representation from Milestone 1.
2. Elliptic curve operations over the representation in 1. These will include at
   least the following:
   * Checking if a given point is on the curve
   * Elliptic curve point addition and scalar multiplication

We will also write tests for general correctness of these operations, without a
specific curve in mind. These tests will be done at the script level, rather
than the transaction level.

## Milestone 3: Plutarch core script for zero-knowledge proofs

Using the operations from Milestones 1 and 2, we will implement a script in 
Plutarch.
This script would verify a zero-knowledge proof over an arbitrary curve, over
arbitrary Galois fields, both specified as part of the datum. This would mint a
token if the proof holds. The goal of this script would be to serve as the
working component of a YTxP design.

## Milestone 4: Correctness for BLS12-381

To verify that the script from Milestone 3 is correct, we will test proof
verification against the BLS12-381 curve. This testing will be done against a
reference implementation using the BLS12-381 primitives provided by Plutus Core.

## Milestone 5: Plutarch YTxP wrapper

We will provide a YTxP-using wrapper, implemented in Plutarch. It will
allow easy and convenient use of the core script implemented in Milestone 3. This 
wrapper will focus on convenience and ease of use, while also allowing
improvements in functionality, bugfixes and security fixes with minimum user
inconvenience. This wrapper will be published as an open-source project.
