Consolidated item\n\nThis proposal addresses several critical challenges and opportunities within the Cardano ecosystem necessary for its continued growth, competitiveness, and decentralization. Key problems include:\n\n* **Scalability Limitations:** The current L1 infrastructure faces throughput constraints during high demand, hindering user experience and application potential. There's a need for significant scaling solutions at both Layer 1 (consensus) and Layer 2.\n\n* **Node Architecture & Performance:** The existing node design presents limitations in terms of modularity, extensibility, performance (especially RAM usage), and ease of contribution from diverse development teams.\n\n* **Smart Contract Assurance & Developer Experience:** Developers require enhanced tools for ensuring the security, correctness, and efficiency of smart contracts to build trust and reduce risks. Improving the Plinth/Aiken/Plutarch ecosystem and providing robust testing/verification tools is essential.\n\n* **SPO Viability & Security:** Ensuring the operational security of Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) and investigating the fairness and sustainability of the incentive mechanism is vital for network health and decentralization.\n\n* **User Experience & Adoption Barriers:** Friction points like mandatory ADA fee payments and unpredictable transaction inclusion during congestion need addressing to improve usability and attract broader adoption.\n\n* **Ecosystem Competitiveness:** Cardano needs to integrate emerging blockchain paradigms like Actively Validated Services (AVS) to remain competitive and offer diverse functionalities.\n\n* **Core Maintenance & Knowledge Transfer:** The foundational codebase requires ongoing maintenance, modernization, technical debt reduction, and structured knowledge sharing to ensure stability and enable broader community participation in core development.",
    "rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nIn this proposal, IOE and its collaborators outline key core Cardano platform developments aimed at substantially improving network scalability, security, performance, and usability, while enhancing developer support.\n\nImplementation of these initiatives offers substantial benefits across the Cardano community, which collectively, enhance Cardano's technical foundations, enabling it to support a larger, more complex, and more active ecosystem:\n\n* **For the Ecosystem:** Delivers massive L1 throughput increase (Leios), robust L2 scaling (Hydra, Mithril), and positions Cardano competitively in new areas like AVS (Minotaur). Enhances overall network security, resilience, and decentralization. Fosters supplier diversity through knowledge sharing and modular architecture (Acropolis). The ROI stems from increased network capacity, utility, and attractiveness, driving adoption and value.\n\n* **For End Users:** Experience significantly reduced network congestion and faster transaction processing (Leios), near-instant finality for specific applications (Hydra), the convenience of paying fees with native tokens (Nested Transactions/Babel Fees), and potentially more predictable transaction inclusion (Tiered Pricing). Enhanced security measures build user trust.\n\n* **For Developers & dApp Builders:** Gain access to advanced tools for building more secure and efficient smart contracts (Plutus High Assurance suite, Plutus Core enhancements). Benefit from a more extensible and accessible node architecture (Acropolis), easier integration with L2s and light clients (Hydra, Mithril), and improved transaction capabilities (Nested Transactions). This lowers development barriers and enables more sophisticated applications.\n\n* **For Stake Pool Operators (SPOs):** Benefit from significantly reduced node operational costs (lower RAM requirements via Ledger-HD, LSM/UTXO-HD), enhanced operational security (KES Agent), improved network performance, potential new revenue streams (Minotaur AVS), and a potentially fairer incentive structure (Revised Scheme investigation). Mithril improvements speed up node synchronization.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nInput Output (IO) realized Cardano's vision for a secure, scalable, decentralized platform through a research-driven, phased delivery (Byron to Voltaire). Leveraging formal methods, functional programming, and rigorous engineering, IO produced key achievements including Proof-of-Stake, Ouroboros consensus, Plutus smart contracts, native tokens, and scaling solutions like Hydra and Mithril.\n\nIOE and its partners' involvement spans the entire existence of Cardano, and is demonstrated daily by its active development, support, and maintenance. Key personnel essential to this long-standing contribution are retained to continue this effort through 2025 and into 2026.\n\nIO remains committed to furthering Cardano's technical development, research and community engagement.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",
