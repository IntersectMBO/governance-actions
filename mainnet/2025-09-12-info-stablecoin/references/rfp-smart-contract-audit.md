1. ### Document Purpose {#document-purpose}

This Request for Proposal (RFP) is issued to solicit proposals from experienced smart contract auditing firms to audit a Cardano smart contract with mechanisms that allow an administrating committee to manage the treasury funds with oversight from dReps. 

**Please note:** The viability and initiation of this project is contingent upon the successful approval of the required Cardano Governance Actions (Budget Info Action and subsequent Treasury Withdrawal). This project will not commence if these governance actions are not approved.

Furthermore, as this project is funded by public treasury funds, transparency is paramount. Please be aware that as part of the Cardano Governance Treasury Withdrawal, it may be necessary to make proposals, in whole or in part, publicly available for community transparency. By submitting a proposal in response to this RFP, you acknowledge and consent to this potential public disclosure.

### 

2. ### Project Description {#project-description}

Cardano is defined by its community. Its governance model incentivizes token holders participating in Cardanoâ€™s unique staking system to decide the future of the ecosystem and how the Treasury funds can be used for the advance of Cardano.

The current project, as detailed in our public documentation ([Info Action](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tRZpHpSZ8V9JRMtjJNu9wahYyHT8eo_IzW90DwQ-SF0/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.kjz9j4vo2ks0), [Governance Protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-z10BIl_0Z2SiCpQMaPvpbQQ8p8fVTpC8S3QRU9JpaU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.fiw190dfcnzk) and [Smart Contract details](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wbiz4fi3lRxLSXGv3p7pNMCKxEykVbjZ-Korso8YijU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.z3nwcw41mf4)), aims to request 50,000,000 ADA (the fund) from the Cardano Treasury to increase the liquidity on Cardano through DeFi protocols by purchasing fiat backed stablecoins.

The fund will be managed through a smart contract-based system on the Cardano blockchain via a Treasury Decentralized Autonomous Organization (tDAO) and an administrative committee, with the following responsibilities:

**Treasury DAO:** composed of dReps, can take actions like create a no-confidence contract state that prevents any new committee actions other than sending funds back to the Cardano treasury, elect or remove new committee members, and setting/removing/changing an end of life for the fund.

**Administrative Committee:** a group of seven administrators that can perform actions like depositing funds to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, engaging 3rd parties for volume or time-weighted average price (V\&TWAP) or over the counter (OTC) deals for converting ADA to fiat, and paying member stipends or other costs (e.g. audits).

This two body system is established to allow the administrators to take quick actions when needed (e.g. pulling liquidity from a protocol) and side step the long time horizon of public governance balanced by empowering the greater Cardano community to oversee the committee.

Currently available high-level details on the smart contract can be found [here](https://hackmd.io/HTq4R80bSGyy0XYMPYnuSg?view)

We are currently running a separate Request for Proposal (RFP) for the development of a smart contract. To ensure the highest levels of security, reliability, and functionality, we are simultaneously issuing this RFP to engage a third-party independent auditor to comprehensively review and verify the developed smart contract. The combined maximum budget allocated for both the smart contract development and its independent audit is ADA 250,000.

Applicants are permitted to submit proposals for both the Smart Contract Development and Smart Contract Audit RFPs. However, to guarantee the necessary independence of the auditing function, only one of these contracts will be awarded per organization.

3. ### Scope of Work {#scope-of-work}

Formal audit of on-chain code of the Cardano Sovereign Wealth Fund smart contract. The high-level details and foundational requirements for the smart contract are provided [here](https://hackmd.io/HTq4R80bSGyy0XYMPYnuSg?view).

**Phase 1: Design & Specification**

* Conduct a comprehensive audit of the proposed design and detailed specification of the smart contract system (once available) to proactively identify:  
  * Unclear or wrong specifications which could lead to unwanted behaviour.  
  * Anticipate common and uncommon attack vectors that could arise from the proposed architecture or logic  
  * Verify that the described contract logic aligns with the intended functionality and appears robust under various conditions  
  * Assess the design against established industry best practices for secure and robust smart contract development on Cardano  
* Produce detailed, actionable reports for all identified findings from the documentation and design review, categorizing them by severity (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational) and clearly explaining the potential vulnerability, its likely impact, and concrete recommendations for design-level remediation or mitigation strategies.  
* Present initial findings to the Committee and the development team through dedicated debriefing sessions  
* Maintain continuous and proactive communication with the development team during their design and specification finalization phase, providing clarification on findings and guidance on proposed design adjustments

**Phase 2: Development**

Along with the delivery of the developed codebase including both the on-chain and off-chain part by the development vendor, the auditor will proceed with a comprehensive code audit. This will involve:

* Review of the smart contract source code in its entirety to identify security vulnerabilities, functional discrepancies, and areas for optimization (as detailed in the previous scope).  
* Verification that the final design and specification have been correctly implemented.  
* Conduct re-audits/verification of all fixed vulnerabilities to ensure effective remediation and that no new issues were introduced during the fix process.


**Phase 3: Final Deliverables & Public Report**

* Submit a comprehensive Internal Final Audit Report that includes:  
  * Executive Summary  
  * Detailed findings from both the design review (Phase 1\) and the code audit (Phase 2), with their severity, description, impact, and a clear record of remediation status (initial finding, proposed fix, verified fix)  
  * Overview of the audit methodology and scope for both phases  
  * Overall assessment and conclusion regarding the contract's security status and adherence to specifications  
  * Recommendations for future maintenance and best practices.

* Provide a Public-Facing Audit Summary Report designed to be concise and shareable. This report shall focus on the final security status of the smart contract, highlighting that critical and high-severity vulnerabilities identified during the audit have been successfully remediated, and provide a clear statement on the contract's overall security status at the time of completion.
