### Naming

Naming throughout follows an ID system
used to easily differentiate and identify each proposal.

The abbreviations are based on what 'bucket' the proposal author chose.

- EC - Core
- EG - Governance
- EMI - Marketing
- ER - Research

There is not too much emphasis on buckets,
we just reuse them here for convenience.
